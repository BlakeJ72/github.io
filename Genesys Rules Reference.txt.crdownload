Genesys Campaign Reference Guide


Space Opera Setting Introduction:
A Space Opera is known for its tropes. It contains grand stories, singular groups of heroes, and high stakes. These are not small-time stories of backwater ruffians. These are stories of galactic proportions where the hero’s actions may determine the fate of the entire galaxy.
        Another classic trope of a Space Opera is impossible technology. Unlike in many science fiction settings where technology is grounded in reality to the best of its ability, space operas treat technology much like a fantasy setting treats magic. Technology can do anything and everything, and often follows the Rule of Cool, where as long as it benefits the story for it to do so, the technology can likely do it. One common example is faster-than-light travel, a staple of the space opera setting. This is necessary to tell the sweeping, galaxy-spanning stories that space operas are known for.
        To allow for the sense of a grand scale that is common in space operas, facets of the setting are often covered in a simplified, brief fashion. This includes planets dominated by a single ecosystem. These could be desert worlds, ice worlds, swamp worlds, and so on, as well as the planets being inhabited by a single alien species. While humans likely show much of the diversity they do in reality, alien races tend to abide by cultural and personality traits across their entire home planet and beyond, with the potential for rare exceptions. Even humans are likely bound by planetary or galaxy-wide governments and cultures, in stark contrast to the fractious civilization of present-day Earth.
        The final important trope of space operas is that they often feature familiar tropes from other genres. This stems from the setting’s favoritism of adventure and excitement over scientific accuracy. Whether taking place in the future or an entirely different galaxy, a space opera might feature elements that would be right at home in a Western, medieval fantasy adventure, detective story, or just about anything else. A space opera setting could include duty-bound, star-faring knights or desperadoes with high-tech revolvers. Characters might wield advanced melee weapons, even though the guns are equally advanced and feature all the advantages guns always do in a knife fight.
















Genesys Dice System:
One of the most important aspects of a tabletop roleplaying game is the dice system and how it works in-game. The Genesys system works very differently than games such as D&D, using its own unique dice, often referred to as Narrative Dice, to determine the successfulness of skill checks and other rolls.
        Genesys uses six types of dice that are compiled into a dice pool when a character makes a skill check, with each type fulfilling a specific function and purpose. Each die face is either blank or features one or more symbols that represent various positive and negative effects. 
        A typical dice pool will contain somewhere between five and eight dice and covers the majority of situations. Difficult, complex, or epic situations may include more dice, while mundane situations may use fewer dice. If the task you are attempting to complete is so easy that success is virtually guaranteed, you may not need to roll dice at all!
        The dice within the Genesys system can be divided into two groups, positive and negative dice.
Positive Dice:
There are three types of positive dice that have symbols that improve the odds of successfully completing a task or achieving beneficial side effects.
Boost Dice: (Blue d6)
Special advantages or “boosts'' are represented by light blue six-sided dice. Boost dice represent benefits gained through luck, chance, and advantageous actions that your character takes. They represent your character’s possession of some sort of benefit or advantage, such as having ample time to complete a task or having the right equipment for the job. Boost dice and Setback dice are thematical opposites from each other.
Ability Dice: (Green d8)
Ability is represented with green eight-sided dice. Ability dice form the basis of most dice pools rolled by the players. They represent your character’s aptitude or skill used when attempting a skill check. These dice possess positive, beneficial symbols. Ability dice are opposed by Difficulty dice.
Proficiency Dice: (Yellow d12)
Proficiency is represented with yellow twelve-sided dice. Proficiency dice represent the combination of innate ability and training. They are most often used when your character attempts a skill check using a trained skill. Proficiency dice can also be added to a pool when you spend a Story Point, which we will talk more about later. These dice possess a greater likelihood of success, and they are the only dice that feature the potent Triumph symbol. Proficiency dice are the upgraded version of Ability dice.


Negative Dice:
There are three types of negative dice that have symbols that undermine the success of a roll or introduce unwanted complications with the final result.
Setback Dice: (Black d6)
In Genesys, certain complications, or “setbacks,” are represented with black six-sided dice. Setback dice represent problems or minor obstacles during task resolution. Setback dice represent relatively minor conditions that impair or hinder your characters, such as poor lighting, obstructive terrain, or insufficient resources. Setback dice are not as potent as Difficulty dice. These are simply added to represent additional circumstances or environmental effects that would not in and of themselves increase the base difficulty of the task. Setback and Boost dice are thematic opposites of each other.
Difficulty Dice: (Purple d8)
Difficulty is represented with purple eight-sided dice. Difficulty dice represent the inherent challenge or complexity of a task your character attempts to accomplish. In simplest terms, the more Difficulty dice in a dice pool, the harder it is to succeed. Difficulty dice possess negative, harmful symbols that cancel out the positive, beneficial symbols found on Ability, Boost, and Proficiency dice. Difficulty dice oppose Ability dice.
Challenge Dice: (Dark Red d12)
Challenge is represented with dark red twelve-sided dice. Challenge dice represent the most extreme adversity and opposition. These dice may be featured in place of Difficulty dice during particularly daunting challenges posed by trained, elite, or prepared opponents. Challenge dice can also be added to a poll when your GM invests a Story Point for an important skill check. These dice feature negative, obstructive results, such as Threat and Failure, but they also feature the potent Despair result. Challenge dice are the upgraded version of Difficulty dice.
  

Percentile Dice:
In addition to the Narrative dice described above, the game also uses standard ten-sided dice. These will be used for percentile rolls, most commonly used to toll for Critical Injuries.


Dice Symbols and Results:
The dice used in the Genesys system feature a number of unique symbols used to determine success or failure, as well as provide additional context and consequences during check resolution.
        It is important to explain these symbols not just so you can play the game, but also so you can help contribute to the story. One of the fun and unique aspects of the Narrative Dice System is that you, not just the GM, can have the opportunity to interpret the results of a skill check. You can add subtle flavor text as you use a result to proc an effect, or even provide ideas for major cinematic changes to a scene (“what if, because of the four Threats I rolled, or ship smashes into the reef and we start taking on water?”)
        This section will introduce and define the different symbols, then describe how they are actually used in play. Just like the Narrative dice, these symbols can be classified into the two broad categories of positive and negative results.


Positive Results:
There are three positive symbols that can be found on the Narrative dice. These symbols represent Success, Advantage, and Triumph.
Success: Sun Symbol
Success symbols are critical for determining whether or not a skill check succeeds. Basically, the more Success symbols you roll, the more likely the check succeeds.
        Mechanically, one Success symbol is canceled by one Failure symbol. Based on the core mechanic, if at least one Success remains in the pool after all cancelations have been made, the skill check succeeds. The other thing to remember is that Success symbols also influence the magnitude of the outcome. The more Success in a check after any symbols have been canceled out by Failure symbols, the greater the magnitude of success (the more damage dealt, the more people persuaded, or the more wounds healed),
        Success symbols appear on all three of the positive dice.
Advantage: Upwards Arrow
The Advantage symbol indicates an opportunity for a positive consequence or side effect, regardless of whether your character fails or succeeds at the task they attempt. Examples of these positive side effects include your character remaining unnoticed when hacking a computer network, finding unexpected cover during a firefight, or recovering from strain during a stressful situation.
        It is entirely possible for a task to fail while generating a number of Advantage symbols, allowing something good to come out of the failure. Likewise, Advantage can occur alongside success, allowing for even better positive outcomes. Remember, Advantage symbols do not have a direct impact on success or failure; they only affect the potential side effects of the check.
        Advantage is canceled by Threat. Each Threat symbol cancels one Advantage symbol. If a skill check generates one or more net Advantage symbols, you can spend that Advantage to apply one or more special side effects. These could include triggering a Critical Hit, activating a weapon’s special quality, recovering strain, or even performing additional maneuvers.
        Advantage symbols appear on all three of the positive dice.
Triumph: Sun in Circle
The Triumph symbol indicates a significant boon or beneficial outcome. Each Triumph symbol provides two effects:
        First, each Triumph symbol also counts as one Success, in every way Success has previously been defined. This means that the Success generated by a Triumph symbol could be canceled by a Failure symbol generated during the same skill check.
        Second, you can spend a Triumph symbol to trigger incredibly potent effects. You could think of this as a “Super Advantage,” although sometimes the effects are so impressive that no amount of Advantage could trigger them. Two common uses include triggering a Critical Injury upon a successful attack and activating a weapon’s special quality (in these cases, one Triumph can do the same thing as many Advantages). Triumph may activate other potent effects as well, including effects above and beyond those triggered by Advantage. These effects may be set by the GM, or they may be defined by the environment, a piece of equipment, or a special character ability.
        You gain both effects with each Triumph symbol, so you don’t have to choose between the Success and the special effect. Although the Success aspect can be canceled by a Failure symbol, the second aspect of the result cannot be canceled. Multiple Triumph symbols are cumulative: each Triumph adds one Success, and each can be used to generate its own special effect.
        The Triumph symbol only appears on the Proficiency die.


Negative Results:
While racing away from enemy agents in a stolen sports car, your character unsuccessfully attempts to weave between a pair of slow-moving trucks. Did your character just scratch the paint on their new car’s fender, or did you fail badly enough that your character was forced off the road? Maybe you failed so badly that your character ended up in a head-to-head collision with a twenty-ton semi! You can find out by interpreting negative dice symbols.
        The Narrative dice include three negative symbols. These results are Failure, Threat, and Despair.
Failure: X Symbol
Failure symbols are critical for determining whether a skill check succeeds or fails. Basically, the more Failure symbols you roll, the more likely you are to fail.
        Mechanically, one Failure symbol cancels one Success symbol. Based on the core mechanic, if at least one Success symbol remains in the pool after all cancellations have been made, the skill check succeeds. Fortunately for your character, multiple net Failure symbols do not influence the magnitude of the failure.
        Failure symbols appear on all three of the negative dice.
Threat: Aiming Reticle
The Threat symbol is fuel for negative consequences or side effects, regardless of whether your check succeeds or fails. Examples of these negative side effects include your character taking far longer than expected to pick a lock on a door, dropping their weapon as they sprint for cover, or suffering additional strain during a stressful situation.
        It is possible for a task to succeed while generating a number of Threat symbols, which can cause some minor or serious complications! Likewise, Threat can occur alongside Failure, which can worsen an already bad situation with some unforeseen headaches. You should remember, however, that Threat symbols don’t directly impact success or failure, only their magnitudes or potential side effects.
        Your GM generally resolves Threat effects (although when an NPC generates some Threat, you and your fellow players can and should suggest to your GM some creative ways to spend that Threat!) Threat may trigger a wide variety of possible effects. These could include your character being knocked flat on their back, losing the advantage of cover, taking more time than anticipated to complete a task, suffering strain, or giving an enemy an opportunity to perform a maneuver.
        Threat cancels Advantage. Each Threat symbol cancels one Advantage symbol.
        Threat symbols appear on all three of the negative dice.
Despair: X in Circle/Hitmarker
The Despair symbol is a powerful result, indicating a significant bane or detrimental outcome. Each Despair symbol imposes two effects.
        First, each Despair symbol also counts as one Failure, in every way Failure has previously been defined. This means that the Failure represented by a Despair symbol could be canceled by a Success symbol generated during the same skill check.
        Second, each Despair can be used to trigger potent negative effects. You could think of Despair as a “super Threat,” although sometimes the effects are so dire that no amount of Threat could trigger them. Two common uses include having a weapon run out of ammo and having a character slip and fall while attempting to climb a rope or ladder. Despair may activate other potent effects as well, including effects above and beyond those triggered by Threat. These effects may be determined by your GM or defined by the environment, an adversary, or a special character ability.
        You suffer both effects of each Despair symbol, so you don’t get to choose between the Failure and the special-effect trigger. The Failure aspects of the Despair symbol can be canceled by a Success symbol; however, the second aspect of a Despair symbol result cannot be canceled. Multiple Despair symbols are cumulative; each Despair imposes one Failure, and each can be used to generate its own special effect.
        The Despair symbol only appears on the Challenge dice.


Dice Pools:
Genesys uses a concept known as a dice pool, which is a collection of the dice needed to determine the outcome of any given situation in the game. While advanced or complex actions may require a large dice pool, generally your dice pools are going to be fairly simple. You create a dice pool based on four factors: your character’s inherent ability, any specialized training your character has, the difficulty of the attempted task, and the equipment your character uses.
        
Basic Task Difficulty:
An important aspect of building a dice pool is the difficulty of the task being attempted. While characteristics and skills, which we will talk more about later, add positive dice to the dice pool, the difficulty is what will be adding the majority of the negative dice to the pool.
        While you determine your characteristic and related skill based on the character attempting the task, your GM sets the difficulty of all checks. There are six basic difficulty levels, ranging from Simple (level 0) to Formidable (level 5). Some modifiers and situations may warrant checks higher than the fifth level, Formidable, subject to your GM’s discretion.
Simple Tasks: 0
A Simple task represents something so basic and routine that the outcome is rarely in doubt. We assume that your character succeeds at most of the Simple tasks they attempt. Generally, your character isn’t required to make a check if the task is so simple that your character is guaranteed to succeed. However, sometimes there is a slight chance of failure, or sometimes there are no consequences for failure, but you need to know the magnitude of your character’s success. In these cases, your GM may require you to make a Simple check.
        A Simple task adds no Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool.
Easy Tasks: 1
An Easy task poses little challenge to most characters, but something could still go wrong, and failure remains possible. We assume that a character with the proper training and resources for a situation can expect to succeed at most of the Easy tasks they attempt. Often, the magnitude or potential side effects are more uncertain than the success itself.
        An Easy task adds one Difficulty die to the skill check’s dice pool.
Average Tasks: 2
An Average task represents a routine action for which success is common enough to be expected, but failure is not surprising.
        An Average task adds two Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool.
Hard Tasks: 3
Characters find Hard tasks much more challenging than Average tasks. Success is certainly feasible, but failure is far from surprising. A typical character with the proper training, resources, and tools for the situation should still expect to fail a Hard check almost as often as they succeed.
        Hard tasks are challenging enough that, before attempting them, you should consider improving your character’s chances by equipping them with specific tools, purchasing specific talents, or purchasing additional ranks in the appropriate skill. You could also spend a Story Point to upgrade the check and increase your character’s chances.
        A Hard task adds three Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool.  
Daunting Tasks: 4
A Daunting task taxes a character, pushing them to their limits. Success may be difficult to achieve, but it’s certainly possible. A properly trained and prepared character should expect failure more often than they experience success. You also run a significant chance of generating a lot of Threat even if you do succeed.
        A Daunting task adds four Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool.




Formidable Tasks: 5
Formidable tasks seem nigh impossible, and if you don’t take them seriously, your character may find them insurmountable. However, with proper planning, a well-trained and well-equipped character has a chance at success. If you need to make a Formidable check, you should make sure your character has all the advantages they can find.
        A Formidable task adds five Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool.


Building a Basic Dice Pool:
When your character wants to attempt some sort of action that might have a chance of failure, you make a skill check. The skill check uses the character’s appropriate skill: Athletics for breaking down a door, Knowledge for recalling facts, or charm for convincing a guard to let the character enter a restricted facility, for example. Each skill has a linked characteristic: Brawn for Athletics, Intellect for Knowledge, and Presence for Charm. When making this skill check, you assemble a dice pool.
        There are two sides to every dice pool: the side to which you, the player, contribute and the side to which the GM contributes. Additional factors may modify the number and type of dice for a check, but note that the GM sets the difficulty level of the task once, prior to the roll. After creating the base dice pool, either side may have the opportunity to upgrade dice, which we will talk about later in this section.
Applying Skills and Characteristics:
A character’s ranks in a skill and ranks in the characteristic linked to the skill are equally important in building a dice pool. When your character attempts a task, you and your GM figure out what skill is most appropriate for your character to use to accomplish the task. Since skills are linked to characteristics, once you figure out the skill to use, you’ll know what characteristic to use.
        Once you know the proper skill and characteristic, you can start building the dice pool. To add dice to the pool, you compare your character’s rank in the skill to the linked characteristic rating.
        The higher of the two values determine how many Ability dice are added to the skill check’s dice pool. Then, you upgrade a number of those Ability dice equal to the lower of the two values (this means that you switch out Ability dice for Proficiency dice equal to the lower value). If your character is unskilled (possesses no ranks) in the necessary skill, then the lower value is automatically zero, and your character does not upgrade any dice.
Applying Task Difficulty:
After determining which skill and related characteristic your character uses to attempt a task, your GM then chooses the difficulty for the task. This difficulty determines the number of Difficulty dice added to the dice pool.
        In some cases, your GM may upgrade one or more of these Difficulty dice by removing them from the dice pool and replacing them with an equal number of Challenge dice. Difficulty dice are usually upgraded into Challenge dice when your character faces skilled opposition or particularly challenging circumstances, or when your GM invests a Story Point to make a check more challenging.
        Assuming no other factors influence outcome, you add the two sets of dice together to make your dice pool. 
Modifying A Dice Pool:
Sometimes other factors can influence the results of a check. Maybe your character is trying to track a foe in a howling sandstorm, or maybe bright lights in a room silhouette the villain, giving your character a clear shot. If an action is important enough to assemble a dice pool, there’s a good chance other factors are involved.
        These other factors can affect or modify the dice pool in a number of ways. The most common ways are by adding dice, upgrading/downgrading dice, and removing dice. These modifications may be triggered by you or the GM, or they may simply make sense given the environment and situation. A few examples of these factors include: obstructing terrain, poor lighting, tactical advantages, time constraints, superior equipment, special talents, unlocked career abilities, investment of Story Points, and Critical Injuries.
        It is also important to note that when modifying a dice pool, players perform the modifications in a specific order. First, players assemble the basic pool, and they add additional dice. Next, they upgrade dice. Then they downgrade dice. Finally, they remove dice.
Adding Dice:
One way to modify the basic pool is to add dice to reflect environmental conditions or various advantages and disadvantages. Generally, this is done by adding Boost and Setback dice.
        As a general rule, your GM adds one Boost die to the dice pool for each bonus that could help your character succeed, and one Setback die for each impediment or disadvantage that hurts your character’s chances.
        It is important to note that while these dice are essentially mirror opposites in their use, Boost dice and Setback dice do not cancel each other out. If the situation warrants the addition of two Boost dice and one Setback die, you add all three dice to the pool.
Upgrading and Downgrading Dice:
Game effects can “improve” dice, basically by letting you remove a die with a lower probability of generating results from your pool and replacing it with a die that has a higher probability for results. Likewise, game effects can “degrade” a die, removing a dice with a high probability of generating results and replacing it with a die with a lower probability for results.
        Note: I said “results” not “success” or “failure.” Both of these effects can apply to positive and negative dice.
        Improving a die is called upgrading while weakening a die is called downgrading. Outside of upgrading based on your character’s ranks in a skill or characteristic, upgrading and downgrading dice most often occurs when your or your GM spends a Story Point to increase the chances of a skill check succeeding or failing. Your character may also have certain talents or other special abilities that allow you to upgrade or downgrade dice.
Upgrading Dice:
        Upgrading dice is a mechanic specific to Ability dice and Difficulty dice, and these are the only two types of dice that can be upgraded. When you upgrade an Ability die, you remove the die and replace it with a proficiency die. When you upgrade a Difficulty die, you remove the die and replace it with a Challenge die.
        When a talent or effect tells you to upgrade one or more dice, you must first determine how many dice are to be upgraded. Once you’ve determined this, you remove that number of Ability or Difficulty dice with an equal number of Proficiency or Challenge dice. When an effect requires you to upgrade dice, the rule always states whether to replace Ability or Difficulty Dice.
        Sometimes you may need to upgrade Ability or Difficulty dice to Proficiency of Challenge dice but you have no more of the available dice (the pool has nothing but Proficiency or Challenge dice in it). In this case, you perform the following steps. First, you determine how many upgrades you still need to perform. Then, using one upgrade, you add one additional Ability/Difficulty die to the pool. If any upgrade opportunities remain, you then upgrade the newly added Ability/Difficulty die into a Proficiency/Challenge die. You then repeat this process until you’ve performed all of the upgrades you need to perform.
Downgrading Dice:
        Downgrading is also a specific mechanic, and it applies only to Proficiency dice and Challenge dice. When you downgrade a Proficiency or Challenge die, you remove the die and replace it with the corresponding Ability or Difficulty die.
        There may be situations where you need to downgrade more dice than are available. If, as you are downgrading dice, there are no more left to downgrade, any further downgrades are ignored.
Removing Dice:
        Just like some effects add Boost or Setback dice to a pool, some effects remove dice from the pool before you even roll them. Most often, this is a result of talents that allow the removal of Setback dice. However, some talents or other effects may remove Boost dice from your skill checks as well; these are just a bit less common.
        The individual talent or effect describes under what circumstances you remove the dice, as well as the number and type of dice you remove. If an ability calls for the removal of more dice of a type than there are in the pool, all of that type of dice is removed and any additional removals are ignored.


Other Types of Checks
As you play, you’ll be using the standard check and basic dice pool to resolve the vast majority of tasks your character encounters in a game session. However, there are some situations you’ll need other types of checks to resolve. In addition to standard skill checks, Genesys uses opposed checks, competitive checks, and assisted checks.
Opposed Checks:
You use an opposed check when the success or failure of a task is strongly influenced by an opponent’s skill, such as when someone tries to prevent your character from succeeding. One example of an opposed skill check would be if your character lies to someone, your character’s Deception check may be opposed by the opponent’s Vigilance.
        Due to the way that Opposed checks are used, they are most commonly used in social encounters when your character tries to influence someone socially, though stealth checks are another common check that uses an Opposed check instead of the standard check.
        Like standard checks, opposed checks add Difficulty and potentially Challenge dice to the check’s pool. However, instead of being determined by the GM, the difficulty is determined by the skills and characteristics of the opposing character.
        When written out, an opposed check is an opposed Skill Name versus Skill Name check. The first skill is the skill your character uses, and the second skill is the skill being used to oppose the check.
Competitive Checks:
Competitive checks occur when several characters try to accomplish the same goal at the same time or try to determine who performs a task better than another. When this happens, the characters engage in a competitive check instead of the standard check.
        For example, two characters engage in a friendly arm-wrestling contest. Each one has the same goal: to win the match by pinning the opponent’s arm. The winner can be determined through a competitive check to see who outperforms the other. Additional examples include several runners competing in a race, or multiple politicians trying to win over an undecided crowd during a debate session.
        For a competitive check, your GM assigns a difficulty level for the task, and each player who has a character involved in the competition makes a skill check using that difficulty. When characters make a competitive check, it’s important to track how many total Success results they generate with their respective pools. The character with the most total Success results “wins” the check. If none of the characters succeed the check, then none win, and the competitive check results in a draw. If two or more characters generate the same number of Success, the check goes to a tiebreaker to see if the draw can be resolved.
        A tiebreaker is broken through the use of Triumph and Advantage. If two characters have an equal amount of Success results, the character with the greater number of Triumph results wins. If the characters are tied on that as well, the character with the most Advantage results is the winner. If it is still a tie, the check is considered a draw. In this case, your GM may simply appoint a winner, declare that all tied parties have lost, resolve the draw with another competitive check, or find some other way to settle the competition.
Assisted Checks:
Some tasks are important or challenging enough that your character requires, or at least appreciates some help. Fortunately, characters can, and should, provide assistance to each other in performing a variety of tasks. Providing assistance is easy. You simply explain how your character wants to help with a task. If the explanation is reasonable, your GM may allow that assistance. 
        The GM can require that certain conditions be met in order for player characters or other parties to offer assistance. You may need to be next to the person, or have access to the object they are working on. 
        Generally, only one character can provide assistance at a time. However, your GM may decide that certain situations can accommodate more people. In this case, only one assisting character can offer their characteristic or skill rating, and all other participating characters contribute Boost dice to the check.
There are two types of assistance that you can provide: skilled assistance and unskilled assistance.
Skilled Assistance:
Assistance works best when the assisting party brings additional insight or expertise to the task. When a character with a higher characteristic or skill rating provides assistance to another character, the dice pool may use one character’s characteristic and the other character’s skill rating.
Unskilled Assistance:
        If the assisting party does not have a higher characteristic or skill rating, so that using either rating would provide no benefit to the other character, your GM may add a Boost die to the dice pool (representing the fact that the additional assistance is still providing some benefit).


Story Points:
Your character (and any other player character) is cut from a different cloth than most NPCs who populate the game world. Not only do they have access to skills and special talents that help them succeed, but PCs are intimately connected to destiny, fate, or whatever you like to call it. Destiny is that special spark that elevates heroes above commoners, imbuing an individual with enough significance in the game’s events to be a player character. Over the course of the PC’s adventures, fate, fortune, or destiny can intervene on their behalf for good or ill. Destiny might manifest in a positive way and provide a temporary advantage or boost to your PC’s abilities. Or destiny might prove an ill omen and impose additional hardships and complications. In any case, your characters are the heroes of the story, and we want the game to reflect that.
        The concept of fate and the player characters’ ability to tap into and influence this resource is represented by Story Points. Story Points are resources that can be invested by you and your GM for a variety of different effects. For example, you can use Story Points to upgrade Ability dice or Difficulty dice or to trigger certain talents or special abilities.


The Two Story Pools:
In the game, there are two pools of Story Points. You and your fellow players can spend Story Points from the player pool while your GM is able to spend Story Points from the Game Master pool.
        Each pool can be identified on the table by creating a pair of circles on a sheet of paper, or by simply designating two areas of the table as the player pool and the GM pool. At the beginning of the session, you and your group add one Story Point to the player pool for each player. Then, your GM adds one Story Point to the Game Master pool.
        You can use just about any small item to represent Story Points. Some suitable items are tokens, beads, coins, or poker chips.


Using Story Points:
You, your fellow players, and your GM can all tap into destiny by spending the Story Points in the right pool. It’s important to note that you and your fellow players may only spend Story Points in the player pool, and your GM may only spend Story Points in the Game Master pool, but that is hopefully self-explanatory.
        When you or another player spends a Story Point, you remove it from the player pool and add it to the Game Master pool. Likewise, when the GM spends a Story Point, they remove it from the Game Master pool and add it to the player pool.
        The point gets moved after you have resolved the action in which you spent the Story Point. This way, players or Game Masters cannot immediately spend a Story Point that has been added to their pool; they have to wait for the next chance to spend a Story Point.
        Another limiter on Story Points is that you can only spend one Story Point during a single action (unless an ability specifies otherwise. If your character has multiple ways to spend Story Points during an action, you’ll have to think carefully about which of those ways provides the best opportunity to spend that Story Point. Likewise, your GM may only spend one Story Point per action.
A Helping Hand:
All characters have the opportunity to call on destiny to enhance any skill check they are about to attempt. You may spend one Story Point to upgrade the ability of your character’s starting dice pool once. In other words, you may upgrade one Ability die into a Proficiency die. Your GM may spend a Story Point in this way to upgrade an NPC’s dice pool.
Raising the Stakes:
Destiny can also be used to help keep characters out of harm’s way. Players can call on fate and destiny to make an opponent’s skill check more challenging. You may spend one Story Point to upgrade the difficulty of any NPC’s skill check once. This refers to upgrading a Difficulty die into a Challenge die. Your GM may spend a Story Point in this way to upgrade the difficulty in a PC’s dice pool.
Special Abilities and Talents:
Many powerful talents allow your characters to spend Story Points for various effects.
Luck and Deus Ex Machina:
You can also use Story Points to introduce “facts” and additional context directly into the narrative. Your GM already does this by managing and directing the story, but this use of Story Points allows you and your fellow players with a means to make contributions as well
        Imagine that your characters land on a planet they expect to have a breathable atmosphere, only to find that a leak at the gas mining facility has rendered the air toxic. One of the players suggests spending a Story Point, saying “Good thing you remembered to pack those space suits last we were in dry dock!” While none of you may have specifically mentioned or listed space suits before, it’s a sensible and creative addition to the game. If the GM agrees, the Story Point is spent, and the player’s suggestion becomes a true statement, there are spacesuits handy in the hold of your character’s ship.


Characteristics:
Your character has six different characteristics, or stats, that define how good you are at different types of checks. These characteristics are Agility, Brawn, Cunning, Intellect, Presence, and Willpower. Each of these characteristics are rated from 1 to 5 for a player, though it is hypothetically possible for some NPC’s to reach ratings higher than 5. Ratings of 1 are below average while ratings of 2 are considered the skill level of an average human, with every rating above 2 increasing your skill level and is all above average. The following section will break down each of the six characteristics.
Agility:
The Agility characteristic measures your character’s manual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and body control. Characters with high Agility are flexible, have a good sense of balance, and have deft hands. Agility is used for a number of physical skills, such as Coordination, and is the key to ranged combat.


Brawn:
A character’s Brawn represents a blend of brute power, strength, and overall toughness, as well as the ability to apply those attributes as needed. Characters with a high Brawn are physically fit and hardy, rarely get sick and have strong constitutions. Brawn is used for a number of physical skills, such as Athletics and Melee. Brawn is also used to determine your character’s starting wound threshold.


Cunning:
Cunning reflects how crafty, devious, clever, and creative your character can be. Characters with a high Cunning are savvy, quickly pick up on vital social and environmental clues, and can more readily come up with short-term plans and tactics. Cunning is used for a number of mental skills, including Deception, Perception, and Survival.


Intellect:
The Intellect characteristic measures your character’s intelligence, education, mental acuity, and ability to reason and rationalize. Characters with a high Intellect can extrapolate and interpolate data, can recall details and draw from previous experience, and can think of long-term strategies and envision the ramifications of present actions. Intellect is used for a number of mental skills, including Knowledge, Medicine, Mechanics, and Computers.


Presence:
A character’s Presence characteristic represents their moxie, charisma, confidence, and force of personality. Characters with a high Presence make natural leaders, draw attention when they enter a room, can easily strike up a conversation with nearly anyone, and are quick to adapt to social situations. Presence is the key characteristic for interpersonal skills such as Charm and Leadership.


Willpower:
The Willpower characteristic reflects your character’s discipline, self-control, mental fortitude, and faith. Characters with a high Willpower can withstand stress and fatigue, remain composed during chaotic situations, and exert influence over the weaker willed. Willpower is used for skills such as Coercion and Vigilance. Willpower is also used to determine your character’s starting strain threshold.


Skills:
Whether flying through a canyon in a blistering-fast starfighter or dueling on the rain-slicked roof of a building, you should expect your character to do exciting and dangerous activities in the course of their adventures. Whether these exciting and dangerous actions succeed or fail is determined by your character’s skills.
        Following is a list of every skill that will be available to learn in the space opera campaign that we will be running, separated into four groups: Social skills, General skills, Knowledge skills, and Combat skills.


Social Skills:
Social skills are what govern social interactions between characters. When your character uses these skills, they try to convince, force, trick, or make a deal for an opposing character to do something your character wants. Thus, social skill checks are often opposed skill checks, which we talked about earlier in this document.
Charm (Presence):
The ability to compliment, flatter, woo, and generally make other people like you is something that’s pretty important to a lot of player characters. For characters who want to be likable, popular, and good at persuading other people to do what they want them to do, Charm is the skill they rely on. A character with a lot of ranks in Charm may be insincerely flattering, or maybe they’re just a genuinely nice person.
Coercion (Willpower):
Some people believe that the only way to maintain respect is to be feared. Others have learned that the best way to get what they want is through screaming and the threat of violence. When your character attempts to instill obedience in a target through the use of threats or acts of physical intimidation, they use the Coercion skill. Characters with multiple ranks in Coercion are often intimidating, scary, or even evil individuals. However, even good-hearted people may use Coercion to intimidate opponents so they can win a fight without bloodshed.
Deception (Cunning):
When your character needs to lie to someone, they use Deception. In fact, the Deception skill covers most attempts to fool or deceive someone, which makes the skill one of the more straightforward skills to use. One thing you should keep in mind, though, is that although lying is one of the most common ways to deceive someone, it’s not the only way. Your character may attempt to trick someone by only telling them certain facts and omitting others, or by using a misleading phrase. But even if you argue that your character technically told the truth, their actions still fall into the category of Deception.
Leadership (Presence):
While some may follow out of a sense of duty or fear, good leaders inspire their followers through a combination of charisma, bravery, and forceful personality. This quality is represented through the Leadership skill.
        Leadership is basically a combination of making smart decisions, being firm and decisive when doing so, and instilling a sense of loyalty and respect in your subordinates. Leadership also represents your character knowing the right decisions to make when authority is called for. Obviously, military commanders rely on Leadership, as do politicians, business owners, and even crime bosses.
Negotiation (Presence):
When your character wants to make a deal, they’re going to use Negotiation. If Coercion is threatening someone, Deception is lying to someone, Charm is sweet-talking someone, and Leadership is telling someone what to do, Negotiation is convincing someone to do what you want by giving them something they want in return. Negotiation comes from getting as much as you can out of a deal while offering as little as possible to the person you negotiate with.


General Skills:
This group of skills represent the majority of the actions your character attempts and is probably the broadest category of skills within the Genesys system.
Alchemy (Intellect):
Alchemy is a skill only known by those who’ve studied on Aurwa, and is a closely guarded secret. It allows for the creation of different elixirs that can affect the body in a myriad of ways, as well as give the ability to convert one material to another, though this effect is extremely difficult to pull off, even in small samples.
Astrocartography (Intellect):
A galaxy is a big place, and characters in a space opera game often traverse one (or more) quite a lot. The Astrocartography skill covers the understanding, use, and development of star charts, including mapping undiscovered systems. It also covers your character plotting courses for interstellar travel.
Athletics (Brawn):
Your group’s characters will likely lead dramatic lives filled with constant physical feats. Sometimes they’ll be fighting an opponent with a gun, but just as often they’ll be climbing mountains, swimming across raging rivers, and leaping across chasms. The Athletics skill determines how well characters perform these actions. It serves as a measure of your character’s overall fitness and physical conditioning.
Computers (Intellect):
The Computers skill grants your character proficiency in the operations of computers and electronic systems. Possessing a lot of ranks in Computers might allow your character to build computer systems, write complex programs, design security systems, or even create lightweight AI for running simple constructs. In addition, the Computers skill allows your character to manipulate computerized systems in ways that might be considered outside of the manufacturer’s specs. In other words, it allows you to do risky, possibly illegal things like hacking, encoding and decoding encryption, and bypassing security systems.
Cool (Presence):
Staying calm and maintaining composure, outwaiting an opponent, generally being cool: these exemplify things your character does with the Cool skill. Cool is something of a defensive skill in nature, since it most often comes up as the skill your character uses to resist attempts to sway or affect them. Cool also represents how your character appears to other people. If your character doesn’t want to show that something affected them, they would use the Cool skill to keep their emotions invisible.
Coordination (Agility):
In the course of adventures, characters sometimes find themselves needing to stay stable on unsteady surfaces, crawl through narrow openings, or even land safely after a fall. Overcoming these types of challenges requires a sense of balance and a heightened degree of flexibility, both of which are represented by the Coordination skill. Coordination serves as a measure of your character’s flexibility, sure-footedness, and hand-eye coordination.
Discipline (Willpower):
Discipline is your character’s ability to focus their mind and quiet their thoughts. Discipline represents your character’s maintaining self-mastery and focus, specifically. Your character also uses Discipline to overcome fear or terror and stay calm in the face of the horrifying. In addition, Discipline represents your character’s mental fortitude to resist threats of coercion or to disobey orders.
Driving (Agility):
The Driving skill includes the operation of all ground-based vehicles, from simple automobiles to multi-car locomotives to high-speed futuristic driving pods. No matter the vehicle, if it uses a motor and traverses land, this is the skill you’ll use to operate it.
Manipulation (Willpower):
Manipulation is the skill related to the manipulation of Halcyon, an ability intrinsically found within the Halcria people. It is possible for others to do as well, but it requires special equipment, and is a well kept secret. The most common use of Manipulation is to connect two points in space, but those with the most skill and training can do nearly anything you could imagine.
Mechanics (Intellect):
The Mechanics skill allows your character to build, disassemble, repair, or modify just about anything mechanical, from a broken radio to a wrecked gyrocopter. In addition, the Mechanics skill is used when salvaging technology, building fortifications, or troubleshooting a malfunctioning water pump, or any time your character needs to swing a hammer or turn a wrench.
Medicine (Intellect):
In the course of their adventures, I expect your character to suffer injuries: everything from cuts and bruises to broken bones and bullet wounds. Medicine gets your character and their friends back on their feet. Any attempt to heal an organic character requires Medicine, as do other medical procedures such as elective surgery and installing cybernetics, and working with poisons, diseases, parasites, and drugs.
Operating (Intellect):
Sometimes, a vehicle is so big that quick reflexes and a steady hand aren’t enough to operate it. When using these sorts of vehicles, for which your character needs training, a sharp mind, and the ability to keep track of a lot of information, your character employs the Operating skill. Operating represents your character’s ability to drive, pilot, fly or sail anything big. Ships, spaceships, or anything with a crew all require the Operating skill.
Perception (Cunning):
When your character wants to make an active attempt to study their surroundings, notice clues in a crime scene, or search for hidden foes, they use the Perception skill to do so. Perception represents your character’s conscious use of all five senses to observe their environment.
Piloting (Agility):
This skill covers the operation of any aerial vehicle that requires reflexes and hand-eye coordination to operate, which in this setting, will mostly be starfighters and space-capable drop ships. As long as it flies through air or space and requires a pilot with quick reflexes and a hot hand on the throttle and joystick (or their equivalent), then you’ll need Piloting to operate it.
Resilience (Brawn):
When the going gets tough, the tough rely on their Resilience skill to keep going. Resilience represents your character’s ability to overcome pain and fight through fatigue. Characters with ranks in Resilience are also better at resisting poisons and diseases, and surviving hostile environments.
Skulduggery (Cunning):
Most roleplaying games have a long and storied tradition of characters disarming traps, picking locks, and (if those tasks fail) breaking out of prison. In Genesys, characters perform these actions with the Skulduggery skill. Skulduggery covers a combination of skills your character would use to engage in covert or criminal activity. If you’re building a character you’d consider a “thief” or “rogue,” this is one skill you should pick up.
Stealth (Agility):
When your character wants to act unnoticed by anyone else, they use the Stealth skill. In many ways, Stealth is one of the simpler skills, and it covers a pretty specific set of activities. However, being stealthy is something that comes up in many roleplaying games, so it tends to be a very useful skill to invest in.
Streetwise (Cunning):
Some call it the “school of hard knocks,” while others refer to it as “street smarts” or “gut instincts,” but in all cases, the Streetwise skill is your character’s ability to survive and thrive in rough and dangerous urban areas. If your character has ranks in Streetwise, they instinctively know how criminals tend to operate, which locations to avoid after dark, where to obtain illicit drugs and services, and other crucial information for making their way in the seedy underbelly of a major city.
        In many ways, Streetwise can be thought of as the urban counterpart to Survival. They both represent many of the same activities, but Streetwise applies to urban areas, while Survival applies to the wilderness.
Survival (Cunning):
There are a thousand tricks your character needs to master in order to survive in the wilderness, and the more ranks in Survival they have, the more likely they are to know them. The Survival skill covers your character’s ability to find food and water, cope with dangerous conditions, hunt and skin animals, and, well, survive in any location that doesn’t have a supermarket on the corner.
        In many ways, you can think of Survival as the rural counterpart to Streetwise. They both represent many of the same activities, but Survival applies to the wilderness, while Streetwise applies to the big city.
Vigilance (Willpower):
Vigilance represents the ability to be constantly aware of your surroundings, often without consciously making the effort. Characters with ranks in Vigilance are more likely to spot threats in the environment, notice important clues out of the corner of their eye, and catch lies as they’re being told.
        You’ve likely noticed from the description that Vigilance, more than most other skills, is a bit of a passive skill. In fact, Vigilance is supposed to be used when your character doesn’t expect a threat, isn’t looking for a clue or is otherwise unaware of something important. This is why we use it to determine Initiative in combat when a character is surprised, to see how much that character was paying attention. It also means that when your GM asks you to make a Vigilance check, you may suspect something is up. Your character, however, shouldn’t be suspicious (unless they pass the check). Vigilance is also one of the skills that you use to oppose certain social skill checks (primarily Deception) when those checks target your character.


Knowledge Skills (Intellect):
Knowledge and information in a roleplaying game can be a tricky subject. Consider how much you know about the world you live in. In a fantasy/sci-fi world, characters should know every bit as much about their fictitious setting as you know about the real world around you.
        Realistically, this is impossible unless you memorize a world guide of the same size and level of details as the Encyclopedia Britannica. To bridge that gap, we have knowledge skills. When the GM needs to determine whether your character knows something, they can have your character make a Knowledge skill check. Success means your character knew it all along, even if you didn’t!
        Knowledge skills also let you make characters who are smarter than you are. That way, when your character needs to recalculate the orbital trajectory of a malfunctioning ballistic missile in the next five minutes, they can make a Knowledge skill check and scribble out the answer on the back of a cocktail napkin even if you, the player, wouldn’t know where to begin!
        Here I have listed five Knowledge skills that I believe will be useful in the campaign, so choose the one you think your character is most likely to know, or fits closest to what you’re imagining.
General (Intellect):
General is the Knowledge skill you would use for someone who has received a high amount  of education or world experience but isn’t specialized in anything in particular. This is also what you would use for any specialization that wouldn’t fit within the other Knowledge skills because it is likely too niche, giving you something extra for having the skill.
Lore (Intellect):
Lore is the Knowledge skill used if your character is knowledgeable in topics such as history or religion. This skill is here for you to know the background of society and their peoples, whether it be actual events, or simply myths.
Planet Ecology (Intellect):
Planet Ecology is the Knowledge skill you use for a character who knows how the different environments of planets affect other factors. This could show knowledge in fields such as Geology, Flora and Fauna, weather patterns, or any other natural effect.
Science (Intellect):
This skill will be used by someone who understands the ways the universe works and why it works. This will help you to understand how a specific piece of technology works, even if you couldn’t build or fix it yourself.
Xenology (Intellect):
Xenology is the Knowledge skill one would use if they have studied how other species in the galaxy work. You will understand the physical strengths and weaknesses of other species, whether they are intelligent or not. This also will give insight into a race's culture, allowing you to better follow their customs.


Combat Skills:
Combat skills feature pretty prominently in most games you’ll play. Basically, when your character needs to punch, shoot, stab, or wrestle someone, they use a combat skill to do so. Combat skills determine how good your character is with weapons, how likely they are to hit a target, and even how much damage they do if they hit.


Brawl (Brawn):
The Brawl skill is what your character uses to fight anyone who’s right in front of them, rather than beyond arm’s reach when your character is fighting without any weapons. Martial arts, wrestling, and unarmed combat are all covered by this skill.
Melee (Brawn):
The Melee skill is what your character uses to fight anyone who's right in front of them, rather than beyond arm’s reach when using a weapon. This skill, in its broadest interpretation, covers any sort of hand or melee weapon.
Ranged-Light (Agility):
In settings where your characters do most of their fighting with firearms, your character uses Ranged (Light) to shoot pistols, throw knives, and toss grenades at their opponents. This skill covers pretty much every light ranged weapon designed to be fired (or thrown) from one hand.
Ranged-Heavy (Agility):
In those same firearm-focused settings, your character uses Ranged (Heavy) to shoot rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, laser rifles, and similar weapons. This skill covers pretty much every heavy ranged weapon designed to be fired while carried in two hands, but not large enough that it requires multiple people or a tripod to use.
Gunnery (Agility):
Your character uses Gunnery, the third of the Ranged skills, to fire machine guns, plasma cannons, heavy railguns, missile launchers, grenade launchers, and pretty much any other weapon large enough that you need a tripod or team of people to use it. Your character also uses it to fire weapons mounted on vehicles.


Talents:
Talents generally represent specialized techniques that a character has mastered, typically through intense practice and study. A character is likely to be more successful when engaged in actions for which they have appropriate skills and talents.
        Generally, skills are what your character uses to perform a task. If your character wants to climb a wall, they use the Athletics skill. Talents, on the other hand, modify how a character uses that skill (such as rerolling a failed Athletics check when attempting to climb that wall). Talents may also modify some of your character’s other attributes, or perform actions normally not allowed by the rules.
        To get a talent, you spend some of your experience points on it. Each talent has an experience point cost based on how powerful the talent. A talent costs 5 times the tier it is in.
        Note: Some talents are ranked, which means they can be purchased multiple times. These talents have a cumulative effect: the more of them you purchase, the better they become. However, after you purchase the talent, that talent now counts as being in the next highest tier for the next time you want to purchase it, meaning the experience cost to buy it again will be higher, and it takes up a valuable higher tier talent slot. If a ranked talent is already at Tier 5, that talent remains at Tier 5 for any further purchases.


Tier 1:
Bought Info:
Tier: 1 
Activation: Active (Action) 
Ranked: No 
When making any knowledge skill check, your character can instead use this talent to spend an amount of currency equal to fifty times the difficulty of the check and automatically succeed on the knowledge check with one uncancelled Success (instead of rolling). At your GM’s discretion, your character may not be able to use Bought Info if the information is particularly sensitive or difficult to find, or buying it doesn’t make narrative sense.
Challenge!:
Tier: 1
Activation: Active (Maneuver)
Ranked: Yes

Tier 3:
Animal Companion:
Tier: 3
Activation: Passive
Ranked: Yes
Your character creates a bond with a single animal approved by your GM. This animal must be silhouette 0 (no larger than a mid-sized dog). The bond persists as long as your character chooses, although, at your GM’s discretion, the bond may also be broken due to abusive treatment or other extenuating circumstances. 
As long as the bond persists, the animal follows your character, and you dictate the animal’s overall behavior (although, since the animal is only bonded with the character, not dominated, it may still perform inconvenient actions such as scratching furniture, consuming rations, and marking territory). Once per round in structured encounters, your character may spend one maneuver to direct their animal in performing one action and one maneuver during your character’s turn. The animal must be within hearing and visual range of your character (generally medium-range) to do this. Otherwise, the animal does not contribute to the encounter. The specifics of its behavior are up to you and your GM. 
For every additional rank of Animal Companion your character has, increase the allowed silhouette of the companion by one (this may mean your character gets a new companion, or their companion grows in size).
This talent can also change in flavor depending on the nature of your game setting. While an animal companion may make sense in many settings, in a futuristic setting it may make more sense for the “animal” to be a robot or drone, for example. 
Barrel Roll:
Tier: 3
Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
Ranked: No
Your character can only use this talent while piloting a starfighter or airplane of Silhouette 3 or less.

Your character must have purchased the Parry talent to benefit from this talent. When your character suffers a hit from a melee combat check and uses Parry to reduce the damage from that hit, after the attack is resolved, you may spend one Despair or three Threat from the attacker’s check to use this talent. Then, your character automatically hits the attacker once with a Brawl or Melee weapon your character is wielding. The hit deals the weapon’s base damage, plus any damage from applicable talents or abilities. Your character can’t use this talent if the original attack incapacitates them.


Tier 4:
Can’t We Talk About This:
Tier: 4
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Your character can use this talent to make an opposed Charm or Deception versus Discipline check targeting a single non-nemesis adversary within medium range. If the check succeeds, the target cannot attack your character (or perform hostile actions against your character) until the end of their next turn. You may spend two Advantage to increase the length of the effect by one additional turn, and spend one Triumph to extend the benefits to all of their identified allies within short range. 
The effect ends immediately if your character or a known ally attacks the target. In addition, your GM may rule that some targets are immune to this ability. An automated sentry turret, for example, has no interest in resolving a conflict through talking, nor would someone consumed by rage and the desire for revenge against your character.

How Convenient!:
Tier: 4
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Once per session, your character may use this talent to make a Hard Mechanics check. If successful, one device involved in the current encounter (subject to your GM’s approval) spontaneously fails. This can be because of your character’s actions, or it can simply be incredibly convenient timing.
Inspiring Rhetoric (Supreme):
Tier: 4
Activation: Active (Incidental)
Ranked: No
Your character must have purchased the Inspiring Rhetoric talent to benefit from this talent. Your character may choose to suffer one strain to use the Inspiring Rhetoric talent as a maneuver, instead of as an action.

Indomitable:
Tier: 5
Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
Ranked: No
Once per encounter, when your character would be incapacitated due to exceeding their wound or strain threshold, you may spend a Story Point to use this talent. Then, your character is not incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your character reduces their strain or wounds to below their threshold before the end of their next turn, they are not incapacitated.
Let’s Talk this Over:
Tier: 5
Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)
Ranked: No
Once per session, when a combat encounter against one or more sentient beings is about to begin, your character can make a Daunting Charm check. If successful, the combat encounter instead becomes a social encounter, with the PC’s attempting to convince their opposition to back down, come around to their viewpoint, or accept a compromise. The GM is the final arbiter of how the situation resolves without violence (or how the combat encounter continues if the character’s check is unsuccessful).
Master:
Tier: 5
Activation: Active (Incidental)
Ranked: No
When you purchase this talent for your character, choose one skill. Once per round, your character may suffer two strain to use this talent to reduce the difficulty of the next check they make using that skill by two, to a minimum of Easy.
Ruinous Repartee:
Tier: 5
Activation: Active (Action)
Ranked: No
Once per encounter, your character may use this talent to make an opposed Charm or Coercion versus Discipline check targeting one character within medium range (or within earshot). If successful, the target suffers strain equal to twice your character’s Presence, plus one additional strain per Success. Your character heals strain equal to the strain inflicted.
If incapacitated due to this talent, the target could flee the scene in shame, collapse in a dejected heap, or throw themself at your character in fury, depending on your GM and the nature of your character’s witty barbs.


Equipment:
Whatever adventures your character goes on, I expect they’ll need some items to aid them. These could be spacesuits and laser guns, swords and plate mail, or a laptop computer and protein bars. These may all seem different, but they are all categorized as equipment.
        This section discusses the rules for equipment, specifically weapons, armor, and items that can’t be categorized as either. It will explain how to buy and sell these items and some details about them, such as qualities and encumbrance.


Rarity:
Some items are naturally more difficult to purchase than others, depending on where your characters find themselves at any given time. Of course, some items are rare no matter where one goes, and likewise, some items are always common and inexpensive.
        Rarity in Genesys measures how difficult an item can be to find on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the easiest to track down and 10 being the hardest. However, whether or not an item is available for purchase is never solely a matter of rolling dice. Instead, your Game Master always has at least partial say as to whether an item is available in a certain location. If it could possibly be available, you will likely have to make a Negotiation, Streetwise, or Knowledge skill check to determine where your character can find an item.  
        The following table lists the rarities with a modern-day example that would go in each.
Selling and Trading:
Although your games won’t constantly involve adventures in commerce, nearly every roleplaying game involves selling items at one point or another.
        When selling an item, your character needs to make a successful Negotiation check. Use the difficulty set by the item's rarity. Your character can generally sell an item for one-quarter of its cost if the check is successful, increasing that to one-half with two Successes and three-quarters with three Successes or more.
        Remember that the GM always has the final say on what can be sold, where it can be sold, and how much it can be sold for. Because this isn’t likely to be a major part of the game, it was deliberately made simple and doesn’t account for a lot of variables that would normally matter when trying to sell an item in real life. If your GM wants to stop your character from selling cell phones to a village without any cell service or have an arms dealer decide that turning your characters into the government for a reward is a better deal than what you’re offering, they are well within their rights to do so.


Encumbrance:
Genesys emphasizes sweeping stories, epic tales, and fast action. Keeping track of the weight of every piece of lost change isn’t fun, but knowing that your character has to carry a child out of a burning building is an important story element; so is having some idea of how many days’ worth of rations your character can carry while journeying in the wilderness.
        In general, you and your Game Master won’t need to track your character’s encumbrance. Occasionally, however, it may play an important part in the story, and you need to know if the weight, mass, and collective bulk of the items your character is wearing inhibits their actions.
Encumbrance Values:
Every item of gear listed has an encumbrance value. Most items that can commonly be carried have a value between 0 and 5, from relatively light objects (such as wallets or light clothing) to heavier items (like hunting rifles or tool kits). When wearing armor, encumbrance is slightly different and we will talk about it more in-depth later, but it simply has less encumbrance when being worn.
        Encumbrance doesn’t strictly represent weight: it also represents mass, bulk, and how easy items are to carry. 
        Small items, such as candles, most pistols, and knives, have an encumbrance value of 1 or 2. Medium items, such as rifles, a satchel of grenades, or a grappling hook and cord, have an encumbrance value of 3 or 4. Large or heavy items, such as cargo crates, light machine guns, or a heavy toolbox, are valued at 5 or 6.
        If it becomes critical to the story to have more detail, ten loosely carried incidental items have an encumbrance of 1. If they are stored in an effective manner, then twenty incidental items have an encumbrance of 1.
        When carried, a living being generally has an encumbrance value of 5 plus Brawn.


Encumbrance Threshold:
All characters have an encumbrance threshold of 5 plus their Brawn rating, which limits how much they can carry under normal conditions without penalty. A total encumbrance value over the threshold means the character is “encumbered,” and suffers on Setback die to all Agility and Brawn-based checks for every point of encumbrance over the limit.
        Further, if a character is encumbered by an amount equal to or greater than their Brawn rating, they no longer earn a free maneuver each turn. They can still perform up to two maneuvers, but each maneuver costs two strain.
Concealing Gear:
It is assumed that your character is going to want to hide items on their person at some point. Maybe they’re concealing a weapon, or maybe they want to sneak a valuable item out of a restricted area. In any case, there are some simple rules for hiding items.
        Items with an encumbrance value of 1 or less can be hidden on a person easily. You don’t need to make a check for your character to hide the item. Instead, if another character tries to search your character, the searcher makes an opposed Perception check vs. your character’s Stealth. Add one Boost die to the searcher’s check for every encumbrance value over 1 that is due to the hidden item. If there are multiple items, use the item with the highest encumbrance value to determine how many Boost dice to add.
        If the opponent isn’t specifically checking your character for hidden items but is just keeping an eye out for anything odd in general (such as a sentry at a city gate), they instead make an opposed Vigilance check vs. Stealth instead of Perception.
        The same rules can be applied to similar situations, such as hiding a rifle in a dumpster full of trash. In cases like this, the Game Master decides what encumbrance value of the object can be hidden without being noticed, and adds a Boost die for every point over that.


Item Qualities:
Some equipment features special qualities that add variety and depth to the weapons, armor, and items your character may encounter. In the game, item qualities are special rules that can change how the item acts. This lets us add more variety to an item than we could by only manipulating raw characteristics. They also make the items more interesting for you, since many qualities may require you to think about your character using that item differently.
        Special qualities are generally passive or active. Passive qualities are always on and require no activation by the user. Active qualities must be triggered by the user, often by spending one or more Advantage results to activate the effect.
        Active qualities require two Advantage results to activate unless otherwise stated in the description. Active item qualities on weapons can only trigger on a successful attack, unless specified otherwise.
Accurate (Passive):
Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology. For each level of this quality, the attacker adds one Boost die to their combat checks while using this weapon.
Auto-Fire (Active):
A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts, flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advantage of using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit multiple targets or to hit a single target multiple times.
        As attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty of the combat check by one Difficulty die. The user may choose not to use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer the aforementioned penalty.
        If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending two Advantage. Auto-fire can be triggered multiple times. Each time the attacker triggers Auto-fire, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of Success on the check. 
        These additional hits can be allocated to the original target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if they wish to hit multiple targets, their initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets.
        Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack, per the normal rules; the Critical Injury must be applied to the target of the specific hit.
Blast (Active):
The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe) engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus damage equal to the total Successes scored on the check.
        In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage.
        If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the user (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending three Threats. In this case, the original target and every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon.
Breach (Passive):
Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor; they are often heavy weapons or weapons mounted on some sort of vehicle. 
        Hits from weapons with the Breach quality ignore one point of vehicle armor for every rating of Breach (meaning they also ignore 10 soak for every rating of Breach).
Burn (Active):
Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues to suffer the weapon’s base damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Apply damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
        A victim might be able to stop the damage by performing an action to roll around and make a Coordination check. The difficulty is Average on hard surfaces such as the floor of a building, or an Easy on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. Both situations assume the flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little the victim can do.
Concussive (Active):
The weapon’s attack can leave the target shell-shocked from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable to perform any but the most basic actions. When Concussive is triggered, one target hit by the attack is staggered for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot perform actions. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
Cumbersome (Passive):
A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward, or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly, the character needs a Brawn characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Cumbersome rating. For each point of Brawn by which the character is deficient, they must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.
Defensive (Passive):
An item with the Defensive quality increases the user’s melee defense by its Defensive rating.
Deflection (Passive):
An item with the Deflection quality increases the user’s ranged defense by its Deflection rating.
Disorient (Active):
A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is disoriented for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Disorient rating. A disoriented target adds one Setback die to all skill checks they perform. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Disorient, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.
Ensnare (Active):
A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts their movements. When Ensnare is triggered, one target hit by the attack becomes immobilized for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ensnare rating. An immobilized target cannot perform maneuvers. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Ensnare, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. 
        An Ensnared target may perform an action to attempt a Hard Athletics check on their turn to break free from the effect.
Guided (Active):
A weapon with the Guided quality can track opponents. The Guided quality can only be triggered if an attack misses. If Guided is triggered, the controlling character may make a combat check at the end of the round as an out-of-turn incidental. The difficulty of this combat check is Average; instead of building the ability of the pool normally, add Success dice equal to the weapon’s Guided rating. If the check is successful, the weapon strikes the target, and the attack is resolved normally. 
Guided requires three Advantages to activate, unless otherwise specified in the weapon’s description. The Guided quality can activate on any subsequent combat check it makes, representing the projectile continuing to track the target.
Inaccurate (Passive):
Inaccurate weapons are less likely to be accurate or precise. When making an attack with an Inaccurate weapon, add Setback dice to the check equal to the Inaccurate rating.
Inferior (Passive):
An Inferior item is a lackluster example of its kind, representing shoddy and poor craftsmanship. An Inferior item generates an automatic Threat on all checks related to its use
Knockdown (Active):
When Knockdown is triggered, one target hit by the attack is knocked prone. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Knockdown, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. 
Unless specified otherwise, Knockdown requires two Advantage to trigger, plus one additional Advantage per silhouette of the target beyond 1.
Limited Ammo (Passive):
Some weapons fire particularly large or complex projectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are expendable weapons like grenades that, once used, are destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to make a number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a maneuver. In addition, each shot expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be purchased or obtained before anyone fires the weapon again. This also applies to grenades and other “one-use” weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here, your character is not “reloading” the grenade, but drawing another to use—mechanically, they are equivalent).  
Linked (Active):
Some weapons are designed to fire together at the same target (turrets housing multiple guns are a good example of this). When a character fires a linked weapon, on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The wielder may spend two Advantage to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of times equal to the weapon’s Linked rating. Additional hits from the Linked weapon may only be applied against the original target. Each hit deals the weapon’s base damage plus damage equal to the Success scored on the check.
Pierce (Passive):
Any hits from this weapon ignore a number of points of soak equal to the weapon’s Pierce rating. If the weapon has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For example, Pierce 3 against a soak of 2 ignores two points of soak, but the extra point of Pierce has no further effect.
Prepare (Passive):
Items with this quality require time to set up before being used. The user must perform a number of preparation maneuvers equal to the item’s Prepare rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon, “using” it would be making attacks with the weapon). At your GM’s discretion, moving with the item, being knocked prone with the item, or other disruptions may require the user to perform the preparation maneuvers again before using the item. 
Reinforce (Passive):
Weapons or items with the Reinforced quality are immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Reinforced quality makes the wearer’s soak immune to the Pierce and Breach qualities.
Slow-Firing (Passive):
Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage, but need time to recharge or cool down between shots. A weapon’s Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired again after attacking. For example, a heavy laser cannon with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being fired before it can be fired again.
Stun (Active):
A weapon with Stun can deal strain to the target. When the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts strain equal to the weapon’s Stun rating. Since this is strain, and not strain damage, it is not reduced by the target’s soak.




Stun Damage (Passive):
A weapon with this quality can only deal strain damage (damage applied to the target’s strain threshold). Because this is strain damage, not strain, it is still reduced by a target’s soak. 
Sunder (Active):
When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from moderate to major. If an item already suffering major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed. 
Sunder requires one Advantage to activate, and may be activated even if the attack is unsuccessful. Sunder may be activated multiple times in the same attack, but each activation must be applied to the same item, potentially taking it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.
Superior (Passive):
A Superior item is a sterling example of its kind, representing masterful craftsmanship. A Superior item generates an automatic Advantage on all checks related to its use.
Tractor (Passive):
Instead of firing searing beams of laser fire or crackling ion discharges, this weapon fires relatively harmless electromagnetic beams that ensnare ships and hold them fast in space. Tractor beams, like all weapons, are fired at their target using the appropriate skill check with all suitable modifiers. Once the weapon hits its target, the target may not move unless its pilot makes a successful Piloting check with a difficulty equal to the tractor beam’s rating. If the target is an individual character, the character is immobilized while the beam is active.
Unwieldy (Passive):
An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be particularly awkward to use for those without impressive dexterity and hand-eye coordination. To wield an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an Agility characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Unwieldy rating. For each point of Agility by which the character is deficient, they must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.
Vicious (Passive):
When an attack with this weapon results in a Critical Injury or Hit, the character adds ten times the Vicious rating to the Critical roll. With Vicious 3, for example, you would add +30 to the resulting Critical Injury or Hit result.


Item Maintenance:
Invariably, items start to wear down. Rolling Despair results may indicate an item has malfunctioned, misfired, jammed, broken down, or otherwise been rendered inoperable or impaired until it can be repaired.
        All items, from low-tech weapons to more sophisticated devices, can be repaired with the Mechanics skill.
        Item damage are generally classified as minor, moderate, or major. The magnitude of the required repairs indicates two things: the severity of any penalties applied to the user when trying to operate the defective item, and the difficulty rating of the necessary repairs. Repairing an item requires adequate time and tools, generally one to two hours per difficulty level. If a character attempts repairs in less time, the difficulty increases by one. Likewise, if the character lacks the proper tools, the difficulty increases by one. These factors are cumulative, so if your character tries to repair a pistol without the proper tools and in half the time it would normally take, you should increase the difficulty of the check by two.  
        The cost of repairs is equal to a percentage of the item’s base cost: 25% if it’s a minor repair, 50% if it’s a moderate repair, and 100% if it requires major work. Reduce the total by 10% for each Advantage received on the repair check if your character is doing the work themself.
        In this game there isn’t much need to to worry about ammunition. Carefully tallying how many bullets your character has in the clip goes against the Genesys game experience (as well as the long-standing traditions of most action movies).
        The way that we will approach the issue of ammo is that Despair generated on combat checks may cause you to run out of ammo. It’s more cinematic and feels like something that would come from rolling a Despair result! (Limited Ammo weapons obviously don’t follow these rules and must be counted for the ammo, but those will mainly be things like rockets and grenades).


Structured Gameplay (Combat):
At some point in nearly every roleplaying game, the time for discussion is over, and it’s time for your characters to roll up their sleeves and kick some butt. Although it doesn’t have to be, expect combat to be a part of many games, and this discusses these encounters going down.


Structured Gameplay Overview:
When using structured gameplay to describe the sequence of events during a firefight, rapier duel, or hectic chase through busy streets, we break the game down into a series of rounds, each of which is further broken down into a series of turns. During a single round, each player character and non-player character gets one turn, during which that character has the opportunity to accomplish tasks and perform various actions. 
        Rounds can represent roughly a minute or so in time, although we’ve deliberately avoided specifying the elapsed time amount. You should keep in mind that a round lasts long enough for your character to move to a new location and perform an important action. You should also remember that although each round is broken up into turns that happen sequentially in gameplay, narratively the turns are occurring at roughly the same time. 
Step 1: Determine Initiative:
At the beginning of the first round of combat, all players and the GM need to determine in what order the characters take their turns. Do the soldiers ambush the supply column, or does the hidden sniper get in the first shot? This is referred to as the Initiative order. 
        To determine the Initiative order, each player character and NPC makes a Simple Cool or Vigilance check. Once all Initiative checks have been made, the GM notes the results of each check and ranks them in order of the highest number of Success to the lowest. If two checks are tied, the check with the most Advantage is ranked higher. If a player character and an NPC are still tied, the player character is ranked higher.
        Note: Cool is used when your characters are ready for the fight, while Vigilance is used when you are ambushed or in some way unready for the fight.
Step 2: Assign Initiative Slots:
Once the GM has determined the Initiative order, they note which results were generated by player characters and which results were generated by NPCs. The results generated by player characters become player character Initiative slots. The results generated by NPCs become NPC Initiative slots. 
Step 3: Participants Take Turns:
Beginning at the top of the Initiative order, the players and GM fill each Initiative slot one at a time with a character turn. If the Initiative slot is a player character Initiative slot, then the players agree on one player character to fill the slot from among the player characters who have not acted yet this round. That player character then takes this turn. While taking their turn, we refer to this character as the active character.
If the Initiative slot is an NPC Initiative slot, then the GM chooses one NPC to fill the slot from among the NPCs who have not yet acted this round. That NPC then takes this turn.
Step 4: Round Ends:
Once all NPCs and player characters have taken a turn, the round ends. At this point, certain effects that last until the “end of the round” may end. The GM also determines if the ongoing encounter warrants additional rounds or if it has been resolved. If the ongoing events continue, repeat step 3 using the same Initiative order generated in step 1. If the action has been resolved and the encounter is over, proceed to step 5. 




Step 5: Encounter Ends:
Once the action has been resolved, the GM ends the encounter. At this point, any character abilities that may only be used “once per encounter” are again available, and any abilities that last “until the end of the encounter” expire. Player characters also have a chance to catch their breath and recover from strain, and they may take steps to help heal any incapacitated characters. 


The Turn:
Each player (whether a player character or a non-player character) gets one turn to act during each round. During their turn, the character can do any number of things, such as dash for cover, attempt to unlock a sealed door, or shoot a pistol at an opponent. The activities the character can perform during their turn are split into three categories: incidentals, maneuvers, and actions.
Incidentals:
Incidentals are minor activities characters can undertake that require extremely little time or effort. Dropping a broken radio, speaking to a friend, or switching on a stun baton are all incidentals. There is no hard limit to the number of incidentals a character may perform during their turn, although your GM may veto excessive numbers of them or decide they are complex enough to warrant counting as a maneuver. The following are examples of incidentals:
* Speaking to another character.
* Dropping an item held in one’s hands.
* Releasing someone the character is holding.
* Minor movements such as shifting position, peeking around a corner, or looking behind oneself.
Maneuvers:
Maneuvers are activities that aren’t complex enough to warrant a skill check, but still involve time and effort on the part of a character. Characters are allowed one maneuver during their turn, and certain circumstances may allow them a second maneuver as well. The following are some examples of maneuvers:
* Aiming a weapon.
* Moving one range band closer or farther away from an enemy.
* Opening a door.
* Diving behind cover.
* Standing up.
Actions:
Actions are important activities that are vital to a character’s accomplishment of a goal. Each character may normally only perform one action during their turn, likely the most important activity they undertake during their turn. Actions almost always involve performing a skill check, although certain character abilities may require using an action to activate them. The following are some examples of actions:
* Hacking a computer.
* Unlocking a locked door.
* Firing a weapon.
* Punching or grappling an opponent.
* Instructing allies with a series of orders.
* Performing first aid on an ally.
* Sneaking up on a vigilant foe.
* Climbing a cliff.
Out of all of these options, the most common during combat are those that involve attacking an opponent. Attacking an opponent requires a combat skill check, sometimes referred to in shorthand as a combat check or simply an attack. 


Incidentals:
Incidentals are anything a character wants to do that takes very little time, or has no measurable effect on the ongoing encounter. This includes dropping something they’re holding, letting go of someone, saying something, looking around, gesturing, or making other minor movements. We have no exhaustive list of possible incidentals, because the possibilities for what a character can do as an incidental are so varied, and because, as we said, most of them don’t have any mechanical effect. 
        Although we have not created a hard limit on how many incidentals a character can perform during combat, we encourage players to limit the incidentals their character performs during each turn to a few simple things. If they don’t, the GM is always free to tell players that the amount of stuff they want their character to do is complex enough that it requires a maneuver, or even an action.
        One other note: generally when it isn’t a character’s turn, an incidental is all they can perform. There are some exceptions, but these are clearly noted in the rules.


Maneuvers:
Just as Genesys uses an abstract method of describing combat, it similarly describes movement in broad strokes. Characters often do far more than shooting or swinging weapons in combat, like pulling out medical supplies to heal a wounded comrade, activating the systems to open a door, or scaling a wall to gain an advantage over their opponents.
        Not all undertakings require a check. These minor activities, known as maneuvers, cover a wide range of activities that any character can perform. They require an investment of time and effort on the character’s part, but they are simple enough that there is no chance of failure when doing them. Technically, characters perform maneuvers during narrative gameplay as well as during structured gameplay, or encounters. However, maneuvers are tracked and defined during encounters, because characters’ time and efforts are more limited by the frantic pace of conflict.
Maneuver Limitations:
Whether taking careful aim at an enemy, diving for cover behind a stack of cargo crates or patching up a wounded friend, a character may perform one free maneuver on their turn. They may perform a second maneuver by voluntarily suffering two points of strain, thereby stretching themself to their limits in order to get more done. Characters may also perform a second maneuver through a particularly successful skill check (by spending Advantage generated on that check), or by other means listed elsewhere. However, regardless of the source, a single character may not perform more than two maneuvers during their turn. 
Maneuvers Outside a Character’s Turn:
In some cases, a character may be able to perform a maneuver when it’s not that character’s turn. An enemy soldier rolling horribly on a Stealth check to ambush a PC may generate a number of Threat on their check. The GM may decide that the blunder allows the would-be victim the opportunity to perform a maneuver, even though it’s the soldier’s turn.
        Any bonus maneuvers gained outside of a character’s turn do not count toward the limit of two maneuvers a character may perform during their turn—specifically because they occur outside of the character’s turn. These additional maneuvers are generally awarded at the Game Master’s discretion, and thus there is no hard-and-fast limit to the number of maneuvers that can be awarded in this manner. However, we encourage GMs to limit the number of out-of-turn maneuvers any character performs each round to one or two at most.
Types of Maneuvers:
The following is a list of the maneuvers a character can perform during combat. Please note that this list is not exhaustive. The entire point of maneuvers is that they can cover any activity that is relatively easy to perform but still requires some amount of time and effort. While the maneuvers listed here are deliberately general to cover as many options as possible, if a player comes up with something they want their character to do that is not covered by this list, they should not dismiss the idea out of hand. Instead, they should explain what they’d like to accomplish to the GM, who can decide if it can realistically be performed in a single maneuver. 
        Some activities may require multiple maneuvers to perform. Generally, these maneuvers must be performed sequentially, without being interrupted by the character performing other maneuvers or actions, for the task to be successful. 
Aim:
During combat, a character can use the aim maneuver to steady a weapon or line up a hit before attacking, which grants a bonus to their next combat check. A character only gains the benefit of aiming if they remain in their current position and do not perform any additional maneuvers or actions before their next combat check. Any damage taken that exceeds the character’s soak also negates the benefit of aiming.
Aiming provides the character with one of the following two benefits:
* Gain one Boost die on the next combat check. If the character spends two consecutive maneuvers aiming, they gain two Boost dice on the next combat check.
* Target a specific item carried by the opponent or a specific part of the target or opponent. This could allow the character to attempt to strike or shoot a weapon from an opponent’s hand, for example, or target an opponent’s limb to hobble them. If the target spends one maneuver aiming to do this, their next combat check suffers two Setback dice. If they spend two consecutive maneuvers aiming, the combat check suffers one Setback die instead.
Assist:
Whether a character is trying to get a truck engine up and running or is using a first aid kit on a wounded comrade, it never hurts to have a little bit of help. Performing the assist maneuver allows an engaged ally to add one Boost die to their next check. Several characters can use the assist maneuver to add more bonus Boost dice to the engaged ally’s next check. All awarded bonus dice must be used on the assisted character’s next turn; otherwise, they are discarded. 
        The Game Master should use their own discretion when allowing characters to assist one another. Some actions simply do not benefit from assistance. Likewise, it is up to the GM as to how many characters can realistically assist another character. 
Guarded Stance:
When a character is confronted by an angry enemy with a weapon, they may be inclined to defend themselves rather than taking an ineffectual swing at their opponent. In such an instance, the character can take a maneuver to assume a guarded stance, which contributes to their defense against melee attacks. A character who performs this maneuver adds one Threat die to any combat checks they make until the end of their next turn. However, they also gain melee defense 1 until the end of their next turn. 
Interact with the Environment:
Often, a single maneuver is enough to interact with the environment around a character. This is a broad category of possible interactions, such as opening a door, ducking behind a wall, pressing a specific button on a control panel, or grabbing a weapon off of the ground. The following are additional specifically designed examples of interacting with the environment:
* Moving a large item. Flipping over a table, shoving a barrel into a pursuer’s path, hefting a crate: each of these takes a maneuver to perform.
* Opening or closing a door. Whether an electronic blast door or a simple door with latches and hinges, opening or closing it takes a maneuver.
* Taking cover. Ducking behind a door jamb, crouching behind a crate, or peeking around a tree trunk: all of these allow the character to gain ranged defense 1 (some cover can grant a ranged defense higher than 1, if particularly sturdy). It takes a maneuver to take cover, but once in cover, the character keeps the bonus unless the circumstances around them change such that they no longer benefit from cover, or they move out of cover.
Manage Gear:
Managing items and equipment is accomplished by this maneuver, which can cover the following options:
* Draw, holster, ready, or load a weapon. This maneuver covers the basic manipulations of most weapons, such as drawing a longsword from its sheath, reloading a laser rifle’s energy cells, or drawing and arming a fragmentation grenade for use.
* Draw something from storage or put it away. A character can perform a maneuver to retrieve an item from a pouch, backpack, satchel, bandolier, or some other accessible container. This maneuver can be used to stow items in a similar fashion.
Mount or Dismount:
Across the many settings in Genesys, characters commonly use beasts of burden to get from place to place. Mounting or dismounting from a domesticated animal, such as a trained horse, requires a maneuver. (Successfully mounting an untrained animal, however, requires an Average Survival check and thus an action, which could be made harder depending on how ornery the GM feels the animal is.) Similarly, entering a vehicle, sliding into a cockpit, or otherwise taking position to pilot a vehicle, crew a gunnery station, or the like requires a maneuver as well.
Move:
One of the most important maneuvers a character can make is to move—from one piece of cover to the next, to a wounded ally’s side, away from the claws of a vicious bear, or out of range of an enemy’s crossbow. The game defines several different broad types of movement. When characters move, they do one of the following:
* Change range increment. Performing this maneuver allows a character to move between short and medium range relative to another person or object. Performing two move maneuvers allows a character to move between medium and long range or between long and extreme range. When covering long distances, multiple maneuvers do not have to be performed on the same turn, but the character is not considered to be in the new range increment until all required maneuvers have been performed. For more information on range, see Range Bands later in this section.
* Engage or disengage from an opponent. If a target is already within short range of a character, the character can perform a maneuver to engage that target. If the character is engaged with an opponent or adversary, they must perform a maneuver to disengage from that opponent before moving to any other location. This only changes their range relative to their opponent from engaged to short and represents the effort of backing away and avoiding their opponent’s attacks. Characters do not need to perform this maneuver to leave an engagement consisting only of friendly characters or allies.
* Move within short range. Performing this maneuver allows an unengaged character to move to another position that is currently within short range of them.
        Note: A flying creature must spend at least one maneuver on Move to stay aloft. This could be changing position or just circling the same position.
Drop Prone or Stand from Prone:
Dropping prone and standing from a prone position each requires a maneuver. Dropping prone allows the character to add one Threat die to all ranged attacks made against them, although they must add one Boost die to all melee attacks made against them.
Preparation:
Some actions require additional preparation to perform safely or effectively. The preparation maneuver is generally performed in conjunction with another ability to confer a bonus, offset a penalty, or fulfill a requirement. The individual talents and abilities that utilize the preparation maneuver define its specific effect. It is sometimes abbreviated under the requirements as “prepare.”


Actions:
During a character’s turn, they generally have the chance to perform one primary activity. This in the character’s action. Actions include any activity complex enough to warrant a skill check, such as slicing into a computer network, firing a rifle, or leaping across a chasm.
Action Limitations:
A character may only perform one action in a turn. Some characters may have abilities allowing them to perform an action as a maneuver. This does not violate the limit of one action per turn, as the action now counts as a maneuver.
Types of Actions:
There are four major types of actions a character can perform during their turn: exchanging an action for a maneuver, spending the action to activate an ability or talent, performing a skill check, and performing a combat check. The last, performing a combat check, is actually a variation on performing a skill check. However, enough unique circumstances surround it that it requires its own entry.
Exchange an Action for a Maneuver:
A character may exchange their action for an additional maneuver during their turn. They may then perform any maneuver they would be able to perform normally, following all the rules that govern maneuvers. However, they still may not perform more than two maneuvers during their turn, no matter how they gained access to them.
Spend an Action to Activate an Ability:
Certain abilities and talents require an action to activate. When a character spends an action to activate an ability or talent (even if spending the action does not require a check or any other activity on the character’s part), they have used their action for their turn. They may not take a second action unless they specifically have an ability that grants them a second action.
Perform a Skill Check:
The most common actions that most characters take during their turns are actions that require a skill check to resolve. In other words, these are activities for which success is not guaranteed or for which the failure of the task may be important to the ongoing story. For example, for most characters, walking from one place to another does not bring with it any inherent risk of failure. Characters who have no relevant injuries or disabilities are assumed to be able to walk from one location to another. Even if a character could fail, failing would not significantly change the ongoing story. However, trying to cross a chasm on a tightrope to escape pursuit brings an inherent risk of failure (falling and possibly dying), and failing can advance the story (whether or not the character escapes pursuit). Therefore, a Coordination check is called for, and if it occurs during an encounter, it requires an action to perform. 
Most skill checks and what they can accomplish are covered in the Skills document. What a character can do with a skill outside of an encounter is the same as what they can do with it inside of an encounter. The only difference is that inside an encounter, they have certain time limits imposed. In fact, the GM can determine that certain activities may require more than one action to perform, if they would normally take a great deal of time. (If the activity is time-consuming enough that it cannot be performed while the encounter continues, the GM may require the character to wait for the encounter to end before attempting the activity.) 
Perform a Combat Check:
A PC makes a combat check when they use a combat skill to attack a target—by firing a gun, throwing a punch, or swinging a sword, for example. This is also referred to as an attack. 
        First and foremost, keep in mind that a combat check is a skill check. It follows all of the rules and procedures for making a skill check, including the steps for assembling the dice pool. However, there are additional steps included in a combat check. All the steps a combat check follows are detailed here. 
Step 1: Declare an Attack and Select Targets
The character chooses to make an attack. They select what skill they use to make the attack and if the skill requires a weapon to use, which weapon they use. They then declare the target of their attack.
Step 2: Assemble the Dice Pool
The character then assembles the dice pool based on the skill, its characteristic, and any applicable talents or other abilities. Certain conditions, such as the painful effect of a Critical Injury or an environmental effect such as fog or darkness, may also contribute dice to the dice pool.  
        The difficulty of a combat check depends on whether the attack is a ranged attack (using the Ranged skill or one of its derivatives, depending on the setting) or a melee attack (using the Brawl or Melee skill or a setting-dependent derivative). Melee attack difficulties are always Average (two dice). Ranged attack difficulties depend on the distance the target is from the active character, or in other words, the range band the target occupies. Once the pool is assembled, roll the dice.
Step 3: Pool Results and Deal Damage
Once the player rolls the dice pool for the attack, the player evaluates the results. As with any skill check, the check must generate more Success results than Failure to be successful. When making a combat check, if the check is successful, each Success adds +1 damage to the attack. If the attack affects multiple targets, the additional damage is added to each target. 
Step 4: Resolve Advantage and Triumph
Just as they can be spent in a non-combat skill check, Advantage and Triumph can be spent in a combat check to gain incidental beneficial effects. However, just as the rules governing encounters are somewhat more regimented than the rules governing narrative gameplay, so some of the options governing the spending of Advantage and Triumph are more clearly defined. In encounters, the player controlling the active character determines how the character spends Advantage and Triumph, unless the GM has a specific reason to decide instead. 
        The first and foremost ways to spend Advantage and Triumph in an attack are to activate a Critical Injury or active item quality. Each weapon has a Critical rating that consists of a numeric value. The user can spend that many Advantages to inflict one Critical Injury on the target, in addition to regular effects and damage. Remember, a Critical Injury can only be triggered upon a successful hit that deals damage that exceeds the target’s soak value.
        Item qualities are special effects and abilities that apply only when a character is using that particular weapon—the vicious edge of a sword, say, or the automatic fire capability of a heavy machine gun. Item qualities come in two forms: active and passive. Active qualities require the user to spend a certain number of Advantage to trigger them. Generally, this is two Advantage, although some qualities may require more or fewer. Passive qualities always grant their effect. Some qualities may inflict effects on a target that, unless specified otherwise, are always applied in addition to other effects, Critical Injuries, and damage. 
        In addition to always counting as an additional Success, Triumph can be spent to activate item qualities as well. A Triumph may be spent to inflict one Critical Injury (no matter what the Critical rating of the weapon is). Alternatively, a Triumph may be spent to activate one item quality, no matter how many Advantage it would normally take to do so.
        There are other options for spending Advantage and Triumph as well. A list of the most common can be found in the following table. Keep in mind that these are not intended to be the only options available. As always, players and GMs may invent other ways to spend Advantage and Triumph, depending on the specific circumstances of the encounter. Any option that the players and GM agree upon can be viable.  
Step 5: Resolve Threat and Despair
In the same fashion in which the controlling player determines how to spend Advantage and Triumph in their combat check, the GM then determines how to spend any Threat or Despair generated in the check. Much as fortune might favor the player, bad luck and circumstance can conspire against them. By default, the GM determines how Threat and Despair are spent, although in some cases (such as checks made by NPCs) they may give the players the option to spend these instead.
        Although many weapon descriptions include options for spending Advantage and Triumph, most do not for Threat and Despair; however, this is not always the case. Some particularly volatile or dangerous weapons do have these options, and if they do, the options are detailed in the weapon’s description. Specific options for spending Threat and Despair in encounters do exist, however, and the most common of these can be found in the following table. As with Advantage and Triumph, keep in mind that these are not intended to be the only options available. As always, GMs may invent other ways to spend Threat and Despair, depending on the specific circumstances of the encounter, and any option that the players and GM agree on can be viable.




Step 6: Reduce Damage, Apply to Wound Threshold, and Apply Critical Injuries  
When a character suffers damage, whether from a rifle or claws, they reduce the damage received by their soak value. If any damage remains after this reduction, they suffer that many wounds. If the net result is zero or negative, the character suffers no wounds; their toughness and natural fortitude, in conjunction with any armor they might be wearing, have saved them from being injured. If the character suffers damage from multiple hits in an attack, they apply their soak value to each hit individually.
        An attack may also generate a Critical Injury. This may occur because the weapon’s Critical rating is triggered, or because the target suffers a number of wounds greater than its wound threshold. More about Critical ratings is explained in Step 4: Resolve Advantage and Triumph.  
        When a Critical Injury is inflicted, the attacker rolls percentile dice on the Critical Injury table on the following page. The result of the dice roll indicates which Critical Injury is inflicted. 
        Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Injury roll, potentially making it more or less effective. If an attack generates enough Advantage to trigger more than one Critical Injury, the character makes a single Critical Injury roll, adding +10 to the result for each additional time the Critical rating is triggered.


Defense:
Defense, or specifically, defense rating, is one of the factors determining how difficult it is to land a successful attack during combat. Defense ratings represent the abilities of shields, armor, or other defenses to deflect attacks entirely, or to absorb or lessen incoming blows.
        A character adds a number of Threat dice equal to their defense rating to all combat checks directed against them, up to 4.
Melee and Ranged Defense:
A character’s defense rating can be classified as one of three types: general defense rating, melee defense rating, or ranged defense rating. A general defense rating applies against all combat checks directed against the character. A melee defense rating only applies against close combat checks directed against the character (Brawl, Melee, Melee [Light], and Melee [Heavy] checks). A ranged defense rating only applies against ranged combat checks directed against the character (Gunnery, Ranged, Ranged [Light], and Ranged [Heavy] checks). 
        There are two sources of defense: sources that stack, and sources that do not stack. You can think of this as sources that provide defense, and sources that increase defense. 
        Sources that provide defense (such as most armor) list the defense provided as a number, or say that they “provide” defense. Some examples include:
* Armor
* Cover
* Certain Talents
* Guarded Stance Maneuver
These sources do not stack with each other. If a character could benefit from more than one of these sources of defense, you choose the best one.
        However, other sources increase defense. These sources say they “increase” defense, or they list the defense provided as a number with a “+” sign in front of it. These sources of defense stack, both with each other and with any sources that provide defense.
        If multiple sources that increase defense would increase a character’s defense higher than 4, the rating remains at 4.


  

Soak:
A character’s soak value helps protect them from incoming wounds. Most creatures and characters have a default soak value equal to their Brawn rating. Most types of armor and other forms of protection provide additional soak.
        When taking damage from attacks (actions involving a combat skill check) or other sources of physical damage (such as being struck by a falling rock or being hit by a speeding car), the character may reduce the damage taken by their soak value. After calculating the total amount of damage inflicted, subtract the total soak value from that damage total. The result is the number of wounds the character suffers. If the soak reduces the damage to zero or less than zero, then the character takes no damage. If the character suffers multiple hits from a single attack (such as from a weapon with Auto-fire), they apply their soak to each hit separately. 
        Soak stacks when it is from different sources, such as heavy assault armor and subdermal plating. Multiple applications of the same source do not stack, however. A character cannot wear three suits of heavy assault armor and stack the soak bonuses from each.
        Soak does not reduce strain inflicted on a target, except in specific instances (such as when hit by a weapon with the Stun Damage item quality).


Range Bands:
Genesys relies on broad terms to describe ranges and distance. Rather than have a player’s attention focused on a grid and counting squares, Genesys uses more abstract means to represent positions, distances, and ranges, thus allowing the players to focus on the action and the adventure.
        The distance between two points—people, objects, or adversaries—is defined by general range categories. These range categories are used to determine how far a ranged attack can reach, how far apart two people are from each other, how much effort is needed to move between two places, and so on. The most common ranges are short, medium, long, and extreme range. Another relative position—engaged—exists to represent characters who are in extremely close proximity to each other.
The Five Range Bands:
For ease of play, distance in Genesys is divided up into five different bands, from engaged to extreme. As always, the GM has the final say in determining the range between the attacker and the target.
        With the engaged status and the other range bands, the GM is free to describe things dynamically and set scenes without having to worry about exact distances. Exact distances in meters do not matter. The details and adventure come first, creating a vivid picture in the minds of the players while allowing the GM to quickly provide the mechanical information they need to use their actions and build strategies.




Engaged:
To reflect two or more targets who are grappling or otherwise engaged in hand-to-hand combat, there is a special range status called engaged. Two characters engaged with each other are in very close proximity. A warrior needs to be engaged with a target to hit them with their sword. When two or more characters are engaged with each other, it is called an engagement.
        Engaged is also used to indicate that a person is close enough to an item to use it. A hacker needs to be engaged with a security terminal to attempt to hack it. A pilot needs to be engaged with their fighter jet to board it. A hunter needs to be engaged with a tree if they want to hide behind it for cover while tracking their target. The engaged status simply indicates that two things are close enough to each other to directly interact.
        Consider engaged as a subcategory of short range. Obviously, someone can be slightly farther away if they’re at short range, instead of being engaged with someone else. However, the difference in distance is relatively minor. Thus, spending a maneuver to move to engage someone or something is as much a matter of moving into combat cautiously enough to avoid receiving a blow unnecessarily as it is moving a physical distance.
Short Range:
Short range indicates up to several meters between targets. Many thrown weapons and small firearms are most accurate at short range. Two people within short range of each other can talk comfortably without raising their voices. Moving to another spot within short range is usually easy to do and generally only requires one maneuver.
Medium Range:
Medium range can be up to several dozen meters away. More reliable pistols can reach to medium range, but few thrown weapons can reach this far. Two people within medium range of each other need to talk loudly to hear each other. Moving from short range to medium range takes little exertion and generally requires one maneuver.
Long Range:
Long range is farther than a few dozen meters. Rifles, mounted weapons, and weapons that use the Gunnery skill can reliably reach this far without too much trouble. Two people within long range of each other need to yell loudly to hear each other. Moving from medium range to long range requires two maneuvers, as it involves a greater distance and takes more time than moving between medium range and short range. This means that in most cases, a character cannot close the distance between short and long range in a single round, as it would take three maneuvers (one for short to medium, plus two for medium to long).
Extreme Range:
Extreme range is the farthest range at which two targets can interact. High-tech sniper weaponry and some vehicle-mounted armaments may reach out to this range. Two people at extreme range may not be able to hear each other even if they shout. Moving between long range and extreme range can be time-consuming and exerting, and it requires two maneuvers. This means that in most cases, a character can move the entire distance between long and extreme range in a single round, but suffers strain or gives up their action to do so.


Additional Combat Modifiers:
This section covers a number of things that can modify a combat check, from environmental factors to actions the character chooses.
Ranged Attacks at Engaged Targets:
Sometimes, characters may want to attack a target engaged with another character. If the target and the character with whom they are engaged are both enemies of the attacker, the attacker may not worry about whom they might hit. However, if one of the characters is an ally, then things become more dangerous. When attacking a target engaged with an ally, the attacker upgrades the difficulty of the check once. In addition, if the attacker’s check succeeds but generates at least one Despair, that Despair is automatically spent to make the attacker hit one of the individuals engaged with the target (of the GM’s choice), instead of hitting the target. 
Ranged Attacks While Engaged:
Sometimes, a character may want to make a ranged attack even though they’re locked in hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. Such an action can be risky; a character may find it hard to take the time to line up a shot while an opponent is swinging an axe at them!
        Any opponent engaged with a character when the character makes a ranged attack (no matter who the target is) may add one Boost die to their next Brawl or Melee check against that character. They automatically lose this bonus if they and the character are no longer engaged with each other.   
        In addition, the difficulty of some ranged attacks increases while the attacker and an enemy are engaged, and other ranged attacks become impossible. You should note that this chart differentiates based on types of weapons because, in the core rules, there is only one kind of combat skill that lets you attack at range. If your setting has multiple ranged combat skills (such as separate skills for “light” and “heavy” ranged weapons), then the ranged modifiers can be determined by skill, rather than weapon size. Generally, it should be obvious which of your combat skills match up with which ranged modifiers. 




Attacking Prone Targets and Attacking While Prone:
A character who is knocked down, unconscious, or willingly drops prone is considered prone.
        Prone characters are easier to hit with certain combat checks and find it harder to use certain combat skills. A character gains one Boost die when attacking a prone target with a Melee check (or any other close combat check). A prone character suffers one Setback die when making a melee attack from a prone position. 
        Prone characters are harder to hit with ranged attacks but suffer no penalties when making ranged attacks. When a character attacks a prone target with a ranged attack, they suffer one Setback die.
        Some attacks or weapons may cause a character to become prone. This is indicated in the individual weapon, talent, or creature attack entry. Getting knocked prone may be the result of a failed Coordination check or of the activation of a weapon’s item quality
Two-Weapon Combat:
A character may opt to carry a pistol or a one-handed Melee weapon in each hand, increasing their volume of attacks at the expense of accuracy.
        When attacking with two weapons, the character must be using weapons that can each be reasonably held and wielded in one hand. Generally, these weapons are Ranged (Light) weapons—such as pistols and grenades—and one-handed Melee weapons or Brawl weapons. If it’s unclear whether or not a weapon can be wielded one-handed, the GM makes the final determination. 
        To make the attack, the player performs a combined check. First, the player designates one weapon as the primary weapon. When making the combined check, the character attacks with this weapon. The player then determines which skills and characteristics the character uses when making attacks with the primary weapon and which are used with the secondary weapon (the other weapon wielded). Finally, they determine the target.
        To assemble the dice pool for this check, the player compares the skills that would be used to make an attack with each weapon by itself and then compares the characteristics that would be used to make an attack with each weapon by itself. They then take the skill that they have fewer ranks in, and the characteristic that they have fewer ranks in, and use this skill and characteristic to assemble their dice pool. It’s very possible that the ranks in either the skills or characteristics are equal, in which case they can use either. If both checks would use the same skill or characteristic, they simply use that skill or characteristic. 
        They then compare the difficulty of the two combat checks they would make with each of their two weapons to hit their target and select the check with the higher difficulty. Then, they increase the difficulty of the combat check by one. Finally, they make the check. 
        If they succeed, they hit with their primary weapon in the normal manner. They may spend two Advantages or a Triumph to hit with their secondary weapon as well. If both weapons hit, they may spend additional Advantage or Triumph to activate item qualities from either weapon. Each hit deals its weapon’s base damage plus one point of damage per uncanceled success.
Unarmed Combat:
Although most characters probably feel more comfortable going into a fight with a good gun in their hand, there are times they must rely on their fists, feet, or other appendages.
        Characters fighting unarmed generally use the Brawl skill. Unlike other combat skills, the Brawl skill is designed to be used independently of any weapon (although some weapons can be used in conjunction with the Brawl skill). 
        When a character makes an unarmed combat check using Brawl, the attack has a base damage of their Brawn rating, a range of engaged, a Critical rating of 5, and the Knockdown item quality. Finally, when making a Brawl attack, the attacker can choose to deal damage to the target’s strain threshold instead of its wound threshold, still reducing the damage by the target’s soak. 
        Unlike other weapons, Brawl weapons augment this basic attack. Brawl weapons can add damage to the attack and may have an improved Critical rating and additional item qualities. When using a Brawl weapon, the user can choose to use its Critical rating instead of the standard Brawl Critical rating. They also add any additional item qualities to the qualities already provided by the Brawl attack. If the weapon provides an improved version of an existing quality, the character uses the improved version.
Improvised Weapons:
Sometimes a character doesn’t have a real weapon available and must make do with anything that is on hand. Swinging a broken bottle, heavy tool, large rock, or tree branch at a target are all examples of using an improvised weapon. 
        Improvised weapons use the Melee skill, and as with all Melee weapons, the attacker adds their Brawn to the damage dealt. Just like weapons with the Inferior quality, improvised weapons generate one automatic Threat on any check. Improvised weapons deal damage based on their size and general weight, as described in the table below. Any attack roll that results in a Despair or two Threats indicates that the improvised weapon breaks and is useless in further rounds of combat. Large improvised weapons require two hands to use if the user is silhouette 1 or smaller.   
Size Differences:
Generally, it’s a character’s skill that governs their chances of hitting a target. However, some targets are easier to hit than others, usually because of their size. Size, or silhouette, is important in the alternate rules for vehicles. However, silhouettes can affect attack difficulties in standard combat as well.    
        When a character makes an attack against a target with a silhouette two or more points larger than they are, they decrease the difficulty of the check by one. When a character makes an attack against a target with a silhouette two or more points smaller than they are, they increase the difficulty of the check by one. 
        The accompanying table has a list of example silhouettes that covers the size of most creatures the PCs may encounter. The most important thing to remember is that most characters are silhouette 1.


Environmental Effects:
Your character may end up adventuring in countless environments, from the frozen wastes of the icy tundra, to lost ruins in steamy jungles, to the bustling streets of busy cities. Characters can often find themselves fighting in hazardous or exotic circumstances, ranging from the cold, hard vacuum of space to the infernal heat of a volcanic planet. The following sections cover rules imposed by those environments.
Concealment (Darkness, Smoke, and Intervening Terrain):
Concealment is a situation that occurs when a character is hard to spot because of environmental effects such as darkness, smoke, tall grass, or mist. Concealment imposes penalties on ranged attacks and sight-based skill checks such as many Perception checks. Conversely, it can provide bonuses for checks on other skills, such as Stealth.   
        The exact bonuses and penalties can be modified by the GM if needed. However, in general, concealment can be divided into levels based on how obscuring the concealment is. See the accompanying table for examples of different types of concealment. In each case, the type of concealment adds a number of Setback dice equal to the “Dice Added” entry to any ranged combat checks, Vigilance checks, or Perception checks against targets with concealment. Conversely, it adds a number of Boost dice equal to the “Dice Added” entry to any Stealth checks made by a character with concealment. These Boosts or Setbacks may also be added to other skill checks if the GM feels it’s appropriate.
Cover:
When the guns start firing, most characters dive for cover. To keep things simple, being behind some sort of cover—a rock, crate, wall, or vehicle, for example— allows the character to gain a ranged defense of 1 and adds a Setback die to certain skill checks, such as Perception. A single Setback die is sufficient for most situations, although the GM may add additional Setback dice if the target is particularly well covered, such as if they are within a trench, blockhouse, bunker, or any other prepared position. The same holds true for the increase in ranged defense. 
Difficult and Impassable Terrain:
Difficult terrain is a catchall description of terrain that is hard to move through or over. It can include tight passageways, slippery ice, thick undergrowth, loose rubble, shifting sand, or waist-deep water (or any number of other circumstances). Essentially, it’s terrain that characters move through with difficulty. Characters entering or moving through difficult terrain must perform twice as many maneuvers to move the same distance they would in normal terrain.
        Impassable terrain is a description of terrain that is simply impossible to move through via maneuvers. This includes sheer cliffs, walls higher than a character can jump, and deep pits. Impassable terrain is not always an insurmountable obstacle, but it’s an obstacle that requires special skills to circumvent. Depending on the impassable terrain in question and the resources at the character’s disposal, the GM may allow the character to overcome impassable terrain by using a skill, probably the Athletics or Coordination skill. During an encounter, this means the character must spend at least one action (and possibly give up one or more maneuvers) to accomplish this.
Gravity:
If your game takes place in a futuristic setting, characters might find themselves in a situation where they are away from an artificial gravity device, floating in open space, or walking in the crushing gravity of a supergiant planet.
        Normal gravity is the default and does not affect any skill checks, attacks, or the like. However, sometimes the characters end up in an environment without normal gravity: a starship with artificial gravity that has been disrupted by damage (or, depending on the setting, a starship without artificial gravity at all) or a large planet with a higher-than-normal gravitational pull, for instance. 
        Stronger-than-normal gravity adds up to three Setback dice to any Brawn-based skill checks (except Resilience checks) and to Coordination skill checks, depending on how strong the gravity is. Weaker-than-normal gravity adds up to three Boost dice to any Brawn-based skill checks (except Resilience checks) and Coordination skill checks, depending on how weak the gravity is. 
        Zero gravity, on the other hand, does not grant any Boost or Setback dice to skill checks, because moving in zero gravity is completely different from moving in a gravity field. Characters can move in three dimensions in zero gravity, but they count all movement as movement through difficult terrain, due to having to constantly grab handholds, evaluate angles, and so forth. 
        A character’s encumbrance threshold does not change due to different gravity, and items still maintain their usual encumbrance. This is because an item’s weight may change, but its size and mass (and therefore its inertia) do not. Those pesky details can prove an unpleasant surprise to inexperienced spacers who attempt to shift something large and heavy while in zero gravity.
Water and Swimming:
Bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and swamps are pretty common in most locations, and sometimes characters need to cross them. Luckily, most individuals can swim, although some may be a lot better at it than others! Unless otherwise noted, characters treat any body of water as difficult terrain. The GM may also decide that some bodies of water, such as a river with a swift current or an ocean in a storm, are so difficult to move through that they require a successful Athletics check to swim in. In this case, it requires at least one action as well as any number of maneuvers to swim through the water from one location to another.  
        If completely submerged in water, a character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Brawn characteristic. Once this number is reached, the character starts to drown and is treated as suffocating on each successive round until they surface or find some other source of air.  
Vacuum:
For astronauts, vacuum is an all-too-familiar and extremely dangerous environment lurking just outside the protective hull of their starship. Vacuum is not just the lack of breathable air; the lack of pressure and extreme heat or cold can cause veins to rupture, blood to boil, and delicate membranes to freeze or tear.
        When exposed to vacuum without protective gear, a character may hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Brawn characteristic. Once this number is reached, the character begins suffocating. Furthermore, during each round in which a character is exposed to vacuum, they also suffer 3 wounds. When the character exceeds their wound threshold, they are incapacitated and suffer one Critical Injury as usual, plus one additional Critical Injury during each additional round in which they are exposed to vacuum (which likely and quickly results in death). This is in addition to the Critical Injuries they suffer from suffocating. 
Fire, Acid, and Corrosive Atmospheres:
Fundamentally, the effects of fire, acids, and corrosive atmospheres are treated with the same rules. When characters are exposed to a fire, acid, or a corrosive atmosphere, the GM determines how dangerous the situation is by applying a rating. This rating is generally between 1 and 10, although higher ratings may also apply. A lower rating typically indicates minor, low-heat fire or mildly corrosive liquid or atmosphere. The higher the rating, the hotter the fire or the more corrosive the atmosphere. 
        Each round at the beginning of their turn, a character subjected to one of these hazards suffers wounds equal to its rating. This damage persists until they are no longer exposed to the hazard. With some corrosive atmospheres, the GM may decide they do not cause damage unless inhaled. In such cases, the character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Brawn before having to breathe and suffer damage.
        It’s primarily up to the GM to decide how long the damage from one of these sources lasts. Acids usually neutralize themselves after a certain period of time (as few as several rounds, or as long as several minutes or hours). Fires burn for as long as they have a fuel source, which again could be very brief or for a very long time. A corrosive atmosphere, on the other hand, usually deals damage as long as the character is exposed to it.
        Putting out fire/neutralizing acid: A victim might be able to stop the damage caused by fire by rolling around on the ground and making a Coordination check. This is an Average check on hard surfaces such as the deck of a spaceship, or an Easy check on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. In the case of acid, it’s up to the GM to determine if the same procedures negate the damage, or if the character must apply some neutralizing substance instead. The only way to stop taking damage from a corrosive atmosphere is to leave it.
Suffocation:
A suffocating character suffers 3 strain each round at the beginning of their turn until they are no longer suffocating (how to stop suffocating depends entirely on the circumstances that led to the suffocation in the first place, but it usually involves reaching a breathable atmosphere or removing something preventing the character from breathing). Once the character exceeds their strain threshold, they are incapacitated. In addition, at the beginning of each of their subsequent turns, if the character is still suffocating, they suffer one Critical Injury. This continues until the character stops suffocating or dies. 
Falling:
Gravity kills. If a character falls from a height, the GM should determine the distance between the location from which the character fell and their point of impact below, then apply the closest comparable range band. Next, the GM consults the accompanying table to determine the damage suffered. Damage is reduced by soak; however, the strain suffered is not.  
        A character can reduce the damage taken from falling by making an Average Athletics or Coordination check. Each Success reduces the damage suffered by one, while each Advantage reduces the strain suffered by one. A Triumph could, at the GM’s discretion, reduce the overall distance fallen by one range band as the character grabs onto a handhold or does something else to arrest their fall.


Wounds, Strain, and States of Health:
In the fast-paced, high-action setting of Genesys, characters are sure to find themselves in the thick of things, and they are likely to pick up a few cuts and bruises along the way. A character’s health is tracked using two separate yet similar systems: strain and wounds. 
Wounds and Wound Threshold:
A wide variety of items and actions can inflict physical damage: gunshots, an angry bear’s claws, frag grenades, falling, etc. Damage to a character’s physical body is tracked using wounds. Each point of damage inflicts 1 wound on a character. A character can only withstand so many wounds before becoming incapacitated. This is represented by the character’s wound threshold.
Exceeding Wound Threshold
When a PC suffers wounds greater than their wound threshold, they are knocked out and incapacitated until their wounds are reduced so that they no longer exceed their wound threshold (likely through healing). They also immediately suffer one Critical Injury. In some rare and dire circumstances, this could result in the PC’s death.
        When non-player characters and creatures suffer wounds greater than their wound threshold, they are defeated (unless they are a high-level opponent such as a nemesis). Being defeated by exceeding their wound threshold usually entails death, but the overall interpretation is up to the GM. The GM can decide that they pass out due to shock, are so injured that they can no longer fight, are knocked unconscious, or suffer any other option that fits the GM’s plans for the ongoing narrative. Since non-nemesis NPCs do not track strain separately but apply strain damage as wounds to their wound threshold, what happens once they are defeated may also depend on whether they were defeated due to strain damage or wound damage. 
        When wounds exceed a character’s wound threshold, the player should track the number of wounds by which their character has exceeded the threshold, to a maximum of twice the wound threshold. The character must heal wounds until the number of wounds they are suffering is below their wound threshold before the character is no longer incapacitated.
Strain and Strain Threshold:
While wounds and Critical Injuries represent potentially life-threatening damage, a number of other stressors and effects can also impair a character. Collectively, this is referred to as strain.  
        Any effect that impairs the character, but does not inflict physical harm or wounds, is considered strain. Spending hours wandering through blistering deserts, suffering a minor shock from an electric console, being battered around the inside of a moving shipping crate— all of these could represent types of strain. Weapons with a Stun or Stun Damage quality or other effects that impair or hinder a character also inflict strain
        Additionally, effects that cause stress, fear, anxiety, or emotional turmoil also generate strain. Losing one’s cool in combat during a bombardment, being berated by a superior officer, waking up to realize one has been imprisoned by slavers, or having one’s ship boarded by an armed search team while smuggling goods are all incidents that could result in strain on a character.
        Strain can accumulate slowly as environmental effects or be gained in chunks when a PC is rattled by an effect that doesn’t cause damage but still impairs them.
        Characters can also voluntarily suffer strain to trigger certain effects. The most common use is to voluntarily suffer 2 strain to gain one additional maneuver during a character’s turn.
        Some talents may require the character to suffer 1 or more strain to activate.
Exceeding Strain Threshold
When a character has suffered strain greater than their strain threshold, they become incapacitated until their strain is reduced so that it no longer exceeds their strain threshold. They are likely unconscious, or they may just be so dazed and staggered that they’re completely unaware of their surroundings and unable to interact with them.  
        When non-player characters and creatures suffer strain, they generally apply the strain directly to their wound threshold (unless they are nemeses and track strain separately). 
States of Health:
Player characters may pass through several states of health over the course of their adventures. State of health is a general representation of overall fitness or well-being.
        A character is unwounded and operating at peak performance if they are currently suffering from no wounds and have no Critical Injuries. 
        A character is wounded if they have any number of wounds below their wound threshold. At this point, they have suffered a few cuts, bruises, and scrapes. However, they have not taken any permanent or incapacitating damage. They’re a bit battered, but they are still hale and hearty overall. 
        A character is critically injured if they are currently suffering from any number of Critical Injuries, regardless of how many wounds they may have. Critical Injuries are actual injuries that have some sort of detrimental effect. A character may be critically injured and wounded.
        A character is incapacitated once they have suffered more wounds than their wound threshold or more strain than their strain threshold. Incapacitation means that a character is unconscious and no longer able to act until the number of wounds or strain they are suffering is decreased below their wound or strain threshold.
        Since exceeding a character’s wound threshold triggers a Critical Injury, it’s possible (and often likely!) for an incapacitated character to also be critically injured.




Ongoing Status Effects:
Characters can suffer status effects beyond being wounded, critically injured, or incapacitated. These status effects can change what a character can do during an encounter, and can be very dangerous.
        Conversely, the power to inflict them on others can be a very potent ability indeed.
Staggered:
A staggered character cannot perform actions (including downgrading actions to maneuvers). Most effects that stagger a character last for a set duration. If a set duration is not specified, the staggered effect lasts until the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is staggered multiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the effect by the instance’s specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter. 
Immobilized:
An immobilized character cannot perform maneuvers (including maneuvers purchased via strain or by spending Advantage). Most effects that immobilize a character last for a set duration. If a set duration is not specified, immobilization lasts until the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is immobilized multiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the effect by the instance’s specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter.
Disoriented:
A disoriented character adds a Setback die to all checks they make. Most effects that disorient a character last for a set duration. If a set duration is not specified, disorientation lasts until the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is disoriented multiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the effect by the instance’s specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter.
Death:
Sometimes, characters die. A time may come when a PC faces their ultimate fate and perishes.
        If a character ever rolls (or, through multiple or untreated Critical Injuries, otherwise suffers) a result of 151 or higher on the Critical Injury tablet, they die (they also have a chance of death with a 141 result). A dead character cannot be brought back to life. Similarly, a destroyed robotic or android character may not be restored—their central processing unit has been irrevocably damaged. Either way, the player should move on and create a new character to continue the adventure.


Recovery and Healing:
While characters can be afflicted with various ailments and types of damage, there are thankfully several options for recovery. Recovery can vary in time and effectiveness, based on the resources and expertise available to the characters. With the proper resources and sufficient time, characters can recover from virtually any encounter.
        
Healing Wounds:
There are several ways that characters can heal wounds. Some allow for natural, if slow, healing; others require access to high-tech medical facilities. 
Natural Rest
For each full night’s rest, the character heals one wound, regardless of the character’s current state of health. At the end of each full week of rest, the character may attempt a Resilience check to recover from one Critical Injury. The difficulty is equal to the Critical Injury’s severity rating. On a successful check, the character recovers from the Critical Injury and is no longer affected. On a failed check, the character retains the Critical Injury, but still heals one wound. A Triumph result means the character can heal one additional Critical Injury. 
Medical Care
A character may attempt a Medicine check to help a character heal wounds. Each character may only receive one Medicine check each encounter, as there is only so much good that first aid can do to help a character.
        The difficulty of the check is based on the target’s current state of health (see the accompanying table for check difficulty). On a successful check, the target heals a number of wounds equal to the number of Success generated by the Medicine roll and heals an amount of strain equal to the number of Advantage generated. 
        A character may also attempt to help someone recover from a Critical Injury by making a Medicine check with a difficulty equal to the severity rating of the Critical Injury. A character may attempt one Medicine check per week per Critical Injury.  
        A character may attempt to heal their own wounds or Critical Injuries with Medicine, but doing this themselves increases the difficulty of the Medicine check by two. In addition, attempting a Medicine check without medical equipment of some kind (such as a first aid kit or doctor’s tools) increases the difficulty of the check by one. 
Painkillers
Painkillers are the generic term for consumable auto-healing items. Regardless of the setting or their name, they all work the same way.
        The first painkiller used on a character automatically heals 5 wounds. The second painkiller only heals 4 wounds, the third painkiller heals 3 wounds, and so on. The sixth painkiller has no effect (we say the target is too oversaturated with medicine or healing magic or whatever to benefit from anything else). 
        Administering a painkiller requires one maneuver, and the character doing the administering must be engaged with the target to treat them. This also means that a character with a free hand can administer a painkiller to themself by spending a maneuver. 
        Painkillers (in any of their variants) can never heal Critical Injuries.
Recovering from Strain
Fortunately, recovering from strain is fairly easy. Taking a moment to catch one’s breath, eating a good meal, and spending time relaxing with friends are all ways a player character might recover from strain.
        At the end of an encounter, each player can make a Simple  Discipline or Cool check. Each Success recovers 1 strain. Furthermore, a good night’s rest generally removes all strain a character has suffered. 
Recovering from Critical Injuries
Since lingering Critical Injuries make subsequent injuries increasingly dangerous, they should be treated as quickly and efficiently as possible. Critical Injuries vary in severity, which represents the difficulty of any corresponding Medicine check to treat and remove the injury.
        It’s important to note that even if the effect of a Critical Injury has expired, the Critical Injury still persists until treated. For example, with a Critical Injury result of 23, which indicates the Off-Balance Critical Injury, the character adds a Setback die to their next skill check. Even after this effect has been applied, the Off-Balance Critical Injury still exists and lingers until treated, making subsequent Critical Injury rolls against the character that much more dangerous to them. 


Social Encounters:
In the previous section, we went over the rules for combat encounters. Just as combat is a common part of roleplaying games, social encounters are also common. So, in this section, we discuss what a social encounter is and some rules for running social encounters. 
Spending Advantage, Threat, Triumph, and Despair in Social Encounters:
Just like combat encounters, social encounters offer some unique ways to spend the different results that your checks generate. You can find these in the following tables. Just remember, these are options and suggestions, but they aren’t an exhaustive list. If you have another idea for spending these resources, suggest it to your GM. If you are the GM, then go for it!












  
  



Using Motivations in Social Encounters:
Motivations are a big part of anybody’s character, so we expect them to come into play throughout a game session. That’s certainly true in social encounters. These rules apply to all characters, both PC and NPC, so they matter for players and GMs. 
Increase or Decrease Your Chances:
Engaging with a target’s Motivation is one of the most common ways for your character to increase their odds of success in a social encounter. Likewise, working against a target’s Motivation makes failure more likely for your character. 
        A simple and effective way to represent those increased odds of success or failure is through adding Boost or Setback dice to a skill check. Let’s talk about adding Boost to your character’s check first. 
        When your character is able to work with a target’s Strength or Flaw, your character adds a Boost die to their next social skill check targeting that character. By “working with,” we mean working some reference to that Strength or Flaw into what your character says or does, or simply choosing words or an action that plays on those Motivation facets. 
        If your character is able to work with the target’s Fear or Desire, the effect is the same, but amplified: add two Boost dice. Fears and Desires are powerful Motivation facets that govern many of a character’s choices, so playing to them can have a greater effect.  
        However, sometimes your character’s approach are going to work against an opponent’s Motivation. This most likely happens because your character isn’t aware of their target’s Motivations. By “working against,” we mean making some reference to the Motivation during an interaction that rubs the target the wrong way, or simply conflicts with the Motivation.
        As we illustrate in our previous example, when your character works against a target’s Strength or Flaw, your character adds one Setback die to their next social skill check against that target. When your character works against the target’s Desire or Fear, they add two Setback dice to their next social skill check against that target.
Discerning Other Character’s Motivations:
Discerning another character’s Motivations can give your character a major advantage in a social encounter. Generally, your character accomplishes this through spending Advantage or Triumph on skill checks. This is the way we recommend learning Motivations, since it’s a logical way to spend these resources in a social encounter, and it encourages characters to interact with each other. 
        However, if you want to have your character study their target and try to discern one of the target’s Motivations that way, your GM could allow you to make an opposed Perception versus Cool check (representing the target’s ability to maintain an even tone and neutral affectation, and not let their internal thoughts tinge their words or demeanor). If you are successful, your GM can let your character learn one of the target’s Motivation facets. 
        Keep in mind, however, that if your character does this, they’ll be spending time in the social encounter quietly but intently studying the target character, something that probably isn’t going to escape notice. Basically, it’s not a good approach if your character is trying to be subtle. Also, the GM should only let your character attempt this once or twice per encounter, and only once per target.


Vehicle Rules:
Some games make interactions with vehicles abstract enough that you don’t need special rules to govern them. However, other games, like ours, prominently feature mechanized walkers, gadget-filled sports cars, and interplanetary starships. This section provides vehicle rules that integrate directly with Genesys, opening up these options to imaginative GMs and players.


Vehicle Characteristics:
All vehicles are defined through a number of characteristics. These characteristics delineate such attributes as the strength of a starship’s shields or how quickly a race car accelerates off the line. The characteristics described here cover the bulk of important mechanical information about vehicles.
* Handling: The measure of a vehicle’s agility and how well it responds to its pilot.
* Maximum Speed: A vehicle’s top speed.
* Silhouette: An abstract of the vehicle’s size.
* Defense: A vehicle’s first line of defense against attack and accident. Typically representative of a starship’s ray shields and particle shields, defense also represents any factors, technological or otherwise, that prevent damage from reaching a vehicle’s armor.
* Armor: The measure of a vehicle’s armor, similar to soak on the personal scale.
* Hull Trauma Threshold: A reflection of the sturdiness of a vehicle’s construction and its ability to sustain damage and keep operating.
* System Strain Threshold: The limit to which a vehicle can be pushed or knocked about before important systems overload or shut down.
Handling:
Handling reflects a vehicle’s inherent agility and the ways in which it responds to its pilot and crew. Enormous sailing ships might require incredible effort on the part of many crew members to turn, while advanced starships might have automated assistance to help pilots avoid obstacles and maneuver optimally. Factors such as shape, control systems, mass, or just general awkwardness all contribute to handling.   
        Mechanically, a vehicle’s handling characteristic dictates the number of Boost or Setback dice added to your PC’s dice pool when making Piloting checks. Pilots add Setback dice equal to a vehicle’s negative handling value or Boost dice equal to a vehicle’s positive handling value. See the accompanying table for types of vehicles and their handling.
Maximum Speed:
An abstraction of both speed and acceleration, a vehicle’s speed characteristic dictates how fast it moves relative to its environment and what maneuvers are available to the pilot. The listed speed is the maximum value at which the vehicle can travel. Vehicles can travel at speeds lower than their maximum listed value.
Effects of Current Speed  
When using vehicles, you should always track their current speed. A vehicle may be operating at any speed from zero to its maximum. Vehicle maneuvers can be used to accelerate or decelerate.  
        Additionally, while a vehicle’s current speed is 1 or higher, certain other effects apply to it (see the accompanying table).
Steering
Each round, a vehicle moves a certain distance based on its current speed. The pilot’s job, in theory, is to control this momentum so as to keep the occupants alive.
        When your character is piloting a vehicle, they must steer the craft. At the beginning or end of their turn each round, you must have the vehicle move a certain number of range bands based on its speed, as detailed in the table above.
        A vehicle generally goes where the pilot wants it to as part of this movement. However, given that player characters are known for attempting to ignore such petty constraints as safety manuals, road signs, and consideration of the laws of physics, you can always require the pilot to perform the dangerous driving action to reach their intended destination (if doing so is possible). Zigzagging through obstacles, turns harsher than ninety degrees, and anything involving safe embarkation or disembarkation without coming to a full stop should almost certainly require the pilot to use this action. If the pilot fails, you, the GM, determine the final position (and condition) of the vehicle, but at a minimum it should veer off course, and at worst, it might suffer a collision with one or more intervening objects (see Collisions).
        If a vehicle has more than one pilot, steering only occurs on the turn of the first pilot to act each round. If a vehicle has no pilot who can steer it, it still moves—but it does so at the end of the round, and you determine its location and any objects it might hit along the way.
Collisions
There are occasions when vehicles will run into the terrain around them, or into another nearby vehicle. In these cases, there are two possible types of collisions: glancing blows (minor collisions) and head-on hits (major collisions). Collisions can be mitigated by ship’s or vehicle’s defenses. 
        In the case of a minor collision, all vehicles involved suffer a single Critical Hit. Subtract the vehicle’s defense times 10 from the number rolled on the Critical Hit table. If the result is reduced to zero or less, the vehicle’s shields or other defenses have nullified the collision entirely, and the Critical Hit is canceled.
        In the case of a major collision, all vehicles involved suffer a single Critical Hit as well. Subtract the vehicle’s defense times 5 from the Critical Hit result. If the result is reduced to zero or less, the Critical Hit is canceled.
        At your discretion, some particularly large vehicles might be able to ignore collisions with very small vehicles. However, larger vehicles have a harder time avoiding collisions with terrain features.
Silhouette:
Much like the speed characteristic, silhouette is an abstract number, used to describe a vehicle’s size and mass relative to other vehicles. Silhouette factors heavily into scale and is used to calculate the difficulty of attacking targets of different sizes. Generally, large vehicles are easy to hit, and small vehicles are hard to hit.
        Silhouettes range from 0 to 10 (or even higher). Silhouette 0 is smaller than a human, silhouette 1 is about the size of an adult human, and silhouette 2 is the size of most cars and large animals. Fighter jets, cargo planes, and tractor-trailer trucks range from silhouette 3 to 4. Navy battleships and starships range from silhouette 5 to 10.
Hull Trauma Threshold:
Hull trauma threshold is a reflection of a vehicle’s sturdiness and resistance to damage. The sturdiness of a ship’s hull and mast, the quality of a bicycle’s chain and gears, and the resilience of a tank’s frame are all represented by hull trauma threshold. Hull trauma generally requires major body work on the vehicle to repair, which can be extremely costly.
        Like the wound threshold of a player character, hull trauma threshold represents the amount of physical damage that a vehicle can suffer before it is rendered inoperable or destroyed. In game terms, when a vehicle exceeds its hull trauma threshold, one of two things happen. If it is occupied only by unimportant characters, such as minion NPCs, it is simply destroyed— crashes and crumples, flips over, or explodes. If it is occupied by plot-relevant characters, such as the PCs or rival/nemesis NPCs, it suffers a Critical Hit and becomes inoperable. Until its hull trauma is reduced to its hull trauma threshold or below, all of its components are compromised (Components are described below).
        Hull trauma threshold is measured in planetary scale (see Planetary Scale versus Personal Scale), meaning that one point of hull trauma equals 10 wounds on an individual.
Components
Most vehicles have a number of components, and these components can be damaged. We list the components and describe what happens when they become damaged (generally from a Critical Hit) here:
* Brakes: If a vehicle’s brakes are compromised, its pilot cannot perform the decelerate maneuver. The vehicle can still coast to a stop over a long distance, or stop by colliding with something
* Defenses: If a vehicle’s defenses are compromised, reduce its defense to 0.
* Hull: If a vehicle’s hull is compromised, its armor becomes 0.
* Navigation: If a vehicle’s navigation is compromised, its handling becomes -3 (unless already lower).
* Propulsion: Propulsion in any form is what moves a vehicle. If a vehicle’s propulsion is compromised, its pilot cannot perform the accelerate maneuver, and its current speed drops by one each round, to a minimum of 0.
* Weapons: Some vehicles are armed with one or more weapons. If a weapon is compromised, it cannot be used.
Repairing components requires a Mechanics check. Often the difficulty is determined by the severity of the Critical Hit; otherwise, it should be an Average or Hard, at the GM’s discretion.
Repairing Hull Trauma
While system strain and the results of some Critical Hits are temporary, hull trauma is more permanent. Repairing hull trauma requires three things: proper facilities, money, and time. Proper facilities have enough tools, light, parts, and workspace to make the repairs to the vehicle.  
        We recommend paying 100 to repair 1 hull trauma, but the cost can fluctuate based on your characters’ reputation, the scarcity of parts, and other factors at your discretion as GM. A good rule of thumb is that light damage (up to a quarter of a vehicle’s total hull trauma threshold) should take an amount of time measured in days, while any damage over that takes weeks or even months to repair.
Emergency Repairs
The pilot or crew of a vehicle with hull trauma that exceeds its hull trauma threshold may attempt emergency repairs by scavenging all available parts from the vehicle and making a Hard Mechanics check. Success brings the vehicle back to some semblance of life. The vehicle reduces its hull trauma to one point below its hull trauma threshold, but its defenses, hull, navigation, and weapons remain compromised until it receives more time-intensive repairs.
System Strain Threshold:
System strain threshold represents a vehicle’s ability to function under rigorous use and the point at which it overheats, depletes its power source, or otherwise ceases functioning. A sailing ship’s system strain threshold might represent the quality of moving parts like the tiller and ropes, while that of a futuristic battle-suit might represent the state of its cutting-edge reactor. 
        Most often, a vehicle suffers system strain due to the actions of its crew, as they push it to (or beyond) its breaking point. Driving a tank over rough ground or sailing a ship through a storm might well cause its system strain, as might pushing the engine of a car beyond its intended limits. You can also spend Threat on the pilot’s checks to inflict system strain on a vehicle, representing the character’s haste or carelessness causing stress to the craft.
        Like the strain threshold of a player character, system strain represents the stress that the vehicle can tolerate before it overheats, breaks down, overloads, or generally ceases functioning temporarily. In game terms, when a vehicle exceeds its system strain threshold, the vehicle’s speed drops to 0 at the beginning of the following round. Until its system strain is reduced to its system strain threshold or below, its components cease functioning, as described in the Vehicle Components section.
  System strain is measured in planetary scale, meaning that one point of system strain equals 10 strain. It is important to note that, unlike personal strain, system strain cannot be recovered by spending Advantage. It can only be restored through actions taken by the crew or slowly over time.
Removing System Strain
While the situation aboard a vehicle that has exceeded its system strain threshold is indeed dire, not all is lost. Any crew member can aid the vehicle in removing system strain by performing repairs and damage control such as rebooting systems, bypassing fried circuits, and putting out electrical fires. This is accomplished through the damage control action.
        Vehicles also recover from system strain slowly over time. For every full day a vehicle spends without taking more system strain, it reduces its total system strain by one. 
Defense:
Defense reflects a vehicle’s ability to completely deflect or reduce the damage of incoming attacks or collisions through ablative armor, deflector shields, point defense systems, illusory duplicates, or other, even more esoteric technologies. 
        Defense works the same as it does for characters; each point of a vehicle’s defense adds one Setback die to any incoming attack rolls (melee or ranged) made against the vehicle.
Armor:
Armor is a flying vehicle’s second line of defense, and the only protection available to the majority of ground vehicles. It represents deflective plating of all varieties, and it soaks up damage from attacks and impacts that are able to penetrate a vehicle’s defense. 
        A vehicle’s armor soaks a number of damage points equal to its rating. Remember that because it functions on planetary scale, one point of a vehicle’s armor is equivalent to ten points of soak on a personal scale.


Vehicle Weapons:
Vehicle weapons share a number of characteristics. These weapons are very similar to those used by characters, but with some differences.
* Range: This is the maximum range of the weapon. Vehicle-mounted weapons use an additional range band for distances, strategic, as described in Planetary Scale versus Personal Scale.
* Damage: This number is the base damage the weapon inflicts with a successful attack. For every Success generated during the attack, the attacker adds +1 damage to the base damage. Unless a vehicle’s weapon has the Personal Scale quality, remember that each point of damage from a vehicle weapon is equivalent to ten points of damage on the personal scale.
* Critical Hit Rating: Vehicles suffer Critical Hits rather than Critical Injuries, and this rating is the number of Advantage required to trigger a Critical Hit on a vehicle with the weapon. If enough Advantage is generated and a Critical Hit is triggered, the character firing the weapon rolls 1d100 on the Critical Hit table to determine the Critical Hit’s effect on the target. Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Hit roll, potentially making it more or less effective. In addition, a character can only generate one Critical Hit per hit on a target. However, if the roll generates enough Advantage to result in multiple Critical Hits, the character can choose to add an additional +10 per additional Critical Hit to the roll result.
* Firing Arc: The direction or directions a weapon can be fired, based on its mounting. These are specified in individual vehicle profiles, and are generally a narrative constraint rather than a hard mechanical limitation. For instance, a forward-mounted weapon cannot fire on a target behind the vehicle, but a turret-mounted weapon can rotate to fire at any target not obstructed by the vehicle’s hull.
* Special Qualities: Many weapons have additional item qualities that affect their performance. Descriptions of these special effects can be found in the Equipment section.


Planetary Scale versus Personal Scale:
Vehicles are bigger than people. They also tend to move faster, and if they have weapons, those weapons are much more powerful than something a person can carry. To represent this, we’ve created something called planetary scale (as opposed to personal scale, which is what your characters operate in most of the time).
        Planetary scale is just personal scale, but expanded. To accommodate a vehicle’s expanded range (and sometimes the expanded range of its weapons), we added in a sixth range band, strategic range. Vehicle weapons also operate at planetary scale, which means they do much more damage then personal scale weapons. We discuss both of these points here.
Strategic Range:
Strategic range is a sixth range band that represents distances beyond extreme range. At this range, people cannot see one another with the naked eye, nor can they interact without technological assistance—thus, it is not included in the standard five range bands. However, when you are using a vehicle, especially one with advanced sensors or other magnification technologies, this is the farthest range at which you can interact with targets. Vehicles can generally detect one another at strategic range unless one or both are going out of their way to be stealthy, but they cannot pinpoint infantry at this distance without sensors, spotters, or similar assets.
        Indirect-fire weapons such as artillery often function at strategic range, as do self-guided weapons like homing missiles and torpedoes. However, most vehicle weapons (such as a fighter jet’s machine guns or a sailing ship’s cannons) do not function at strategic range, and have ranges of long or extreme instead. As a general rule, we limit most weapons requiring direct line of sight to extreme range.
        As strategic range is the sixth range band, the difficulty of making ranged combat checks at strategic range is Formidable. 
Range Bands in Space
Space is really, really big. When we discuss range bands earlier, it doesn't seem like those distances are big enough to really represent the distances in space. However, the beauty of range bands is that they're not tied to a specific, measurable distance. So, we recommend that when you use vehicles in space, you scale up the ranges slightly. Engaged may be two spacecraft docked with each other, and short and medium range may be only slightly farther than their equivalents on the ground. But long range and extreme range may represent hundreds of kilometers, while strategic range may represent thousands. 
Planetary Scale Combat:
When dealing with a vehicle’s weapons, armor, and hull trauma threshold, every point is equal to ten points of the equivalent characteristic in the personal scale. For example, a machine gun with a base damage of 3 mounted on a helicopter deals three points of damage when fired at another vehicle, but thirty points of damage when fired at a human. Conversely, a human-sized assault rifle would need to deal ten points of damage to a helicopter to inflict even one point of damage on it.
        Note that planetary scale weapons deal massive amounts of damage to individuals. Most hits deal enough damage to far exceed a character’s wound threshold, automatically incapacitating the target. However, you may feel this is insufficient to represent the power of these weapons, so you may have characters add +50 to the resulting Critical Injury roll. (Also, those “hit” by a planetary scale weapon might be on the periphery of the blast zone, explaining why they survived somewhat unscathed.) 
        Also note that to avoid having weapons such as pistols dealing Critical Hits to heavily armored combat craft, their damage must exceed a starship’s armor before the shot can inflict a Critical Hit.
Item Quality: Personal Scale
This quality exists only for vehicle weapons. We use this quality when we want to put small-scale weapons on a vehicle, such as the machine guns on the side of a combat helicopter, or a grenade launcher on an APC.
        The quality has the following rule: this vehicle weapon’s entire profile uses personal scale instead of planetary scale.


Vehicle Combat:
Combat engagements between vehicles function using the same basic combat rules as found in the Structured Gameplay section. Vehicle combat is not intended to be a completely separate rules system. Instead, it is designed to be an added layer of detail on the standard combat rules that allows you to run structured gameplay encounters using characters, vehicles, or both.
Small Vehicle Combat:
Combat between small vehicles like tanks, fighter jets, personal spacecraft, or attack walkers is relatively straightforward. The pilot has one vehicle maneuver and one vehicle action (or two vehicle maneuvers) during each turn. 
        Small vehicle combat (especially with high-speed vehicles like fighter jets) is quite abstracted. As they constantly move and strive for the advantage (thanks to their incredible speed and agility), it would be nearly impossible to map out every move a fighter jet makes. Instead, you and your players describe the actions the characters take, embellish them with narrative flair, and then make skill checks to resolve the actions. 
Capital Ship Combat:
Combat in larger, capital-class vehicles such as battleships (of the aquatic or stellar variety) is, by necessity, more abstract due to their complexity and the number of crew members involved. Like small vehicles in combat, capital ships can only perform one vehicle maneuver and one vehicle action (or two vehicle maneuvers) during their turn, as directed by the pilot or captain.  
        Along with the pilot, each additional crew member can use their personal actions and maneuvers to crew weapons, operate sensors, move about the ship, and generally engage in combat. This all happens in the same round, and it is subject to Initiative order just like personal combat. Something to remember concerning vehicle combat with capital ships is that each capital ship is likely to have hundreds or thousands of crew. GMs and players should not track all of their Initiative slots and actions during combat. Instead, only focus on those individuals who are doing things pertinent to the ongoing encounter, and feel free to ignore the rest.
Mixed Personal and Vehicle Combat:
Sometimes, characters might engage with vehicles despite being on foot, or a battle might contain armor and infantry elements. Characters on foot might even be pursued by enemies with small vehicles like motorcycles or horses, or a character might be thrown from their vehicle mid-battle. In such cases, the characters in vehicles behave as if they are involved in a small vehicle combat (or even a capital ship combat), while those outside of vehicles take their turns as usual, as described in Structured Gameplay:
        Although foot soldiers generally do not appreciate fighting tanks, they do have one advantage: they are harder to hit than most vehicles. As smaller targets, they are harder to hit, whereas infantry can hit tanks with ease, even if they struggle to damage them. Although difficulty for combat checks is set based on range, smaller individuals still get bonuses for attacking things larger than they are.


Combat Turns:
Much like personal combat, combat between vehicles in Genesys is largely an abstract, narrative-driven activity designed for quickness and ease of use. As such, the maneuvers a vehicle performs are open to narration and the interpretation of you and your players.
        Player character pilots follow the same rules of combat as detailed in Structured Gameplay. This means they can perform one action and one maneuver during their turn. They may also be able to perform a second maneuver by either suffering strain or spending Advantage, although they cannot take more than two maneuvers during their turn.
Pilot Only Maneuvers and Actions
Some maneuvers and actions are specified as “Pilot Only.” Pilot Only maneuvers and actions affect the current speed and positioning of the vehicle. As each vehicle has a cap on how far and how swiftly it can move, its maneuvers and actions are limited, as described below.
        A vehicle can benefit from only one Pilot Only action per round.
        Additionally, a vehicle can benefit from one Pilot Only maneuver per round, and it can benefit from a second Pilot Only maneuver if it suffers 2 system strain. If the vehicle has a single pilot, the pilot must also suffer 2 strain (or downgrade an action to a maneuver) to perform two maneuvers, as per combat rules. 
        Some vehicles can have multiple pilots, in which case two different pilots can each perform a Pilot Only maneuver. In such cases, the vehicle suffers system strain for the second maneuver, but the second pilot does not.
Maneuvers:
Less involved than actions, maneuvers are simple activities that do not typically require a skill check. Beyond all the maneuvers in personal combat, there are several maneuvers that apply specifically to vehicles. These additional maneuvers follow the usual rules governing maneuvers. In addition (and especially in larger vehicles), characters are assumed to be able to perform any personal maneuvers such as dropping prone, managing gear, interacting with the environment, or aiming with vehicle or personal weapons (although you should use common sense as to what a character can and cannot do given the situation). 
        All maneuvers have a current speed, which is how fast the vehicle has to be going to perform the maneuver.
Accelerate:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: Any 
Current Speed: Any
The pilot may increase the vehicle’s current speed by one or more, to a maximum of the vehicle’s maximum speed. The vehicle suffers a number of system strain equal to the amount its speed increased minus 1, to a minimum of 0.
Brace for Impact:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: Any 
Current Speed: Any
Once per round, the pilot may use this maneuver to adjust the vehicle’s position to minimize incoming damage. Until the beginning of the pilot’s next turn, whenever the vehicle is dealt damage, the pilot may have the vehicle suffer system strain up to its silhouette to reduce the damage it suffers by that amount, to a minimum of 0.  
        Additionally, until the beginning of the pilot’s next turn, whenever the vehicle suffers a Critical Hit, the pilot may have the vehicle suffer system strain up to its silhouette to reduce the Critical Hit result by ten per point of strain it gains this way, to a minimum of 0. If the result is reduced to 0 this way, the Critical Hit is canceled.
Decelerate:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: Any 
Current Speed: 1+
The pilot may decrease the vehicle’s current speed by one or more, to a minimum of 0. The vehicle suffers a number of strain equal to the amount its speed decreased minus 1, to a minimum of 0.
Evade:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: 0-4 
Current Speed: 3+
Once per round, the pilot may perform this maneuver to dodge incoming fire. Until the beginning of the pilot’s next turn, upgrade the difficulty of all attacks made against the vehicle and by characters in the vehicle.
Reposition:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: Any 
Current Speed: 1+
The pilot may move the vehicle one range band. This maneuver reflects minor repositioning to avoid obstacles, close or widen distances in a chase, or otherwise shift within the environment in small ways.


Actions:
In combat involving vehicles, your character can perform some actions that specifically apply to their vehicle. Some of these actions are labeled as Pilot Only actions. A vehicle may benefit from only one Pilot Only action per round (see Pilot Only Maneuvers and Actions). Pilot Only actions are actions that affect the movement of the vehicle itself, which may only move so fast and so far.
        Like vehicle maneuvers, vehicle actions have a current speed requirement that the vehicle has to be traveling at to perform the action. Also remember that any of the actions listed in Structured Gameplay can also be performed in combats involving vehicles, within the bounds of common sense.
Dangerous Driving:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: Any 
Current Speed: 1+
The pilot attempts to control the vehicle as it takes a sharp turn, tries to coax the vehicle through a series of narrowly placed obstacles, or otherwise perform an improbable feat of operating prowess.
        When performing the Dangerous Driving action, the character makes a Piloting check with a difficulty equal to the silhouette of the vehicle. Keep in mind that the current speed of the vehicle can alter the difficulty of such checks- and amplify the consequences of failure!
Blanket Barrage:
Pilot Only: No 
Silhouette: 5+
Current Speed: 0-3
The gunner uses the ship’s weapons to raise a curtain of fire around the ship, protecting it from smaller vehicles. Any smaller vehicle attempting an attack run must brave a hurricane of heavy weaponry. This action also speeds up combat when your vehicle has lots of guns.
        When performing the Blanket Barrage action, your character makes an Average Gunnery check and selects all weapons of a single type that share a firing arc. Those weapons count as firing that round. This action requires at least two weapons to use, and it cannot be used if there are not two weapons of a single type that share a firing arc. Until the end of their next turn, all vehicles of silhouette 4 or smaller upgrade the difficulty of any combat checks made against your character’s vehicle once, plus one additional time per two Advantage on the check. If their combat check generates two Threat, they suffer one automatic hit, which deals half the base damage (rounding up) of the type of weapon used in the Blanket Barrage action. If their combat check generates a Despair, they suffer one automatic hit dealing the full base damage instead.
        At the GM’s discretion, the Blanket Barrage might not cover all arcs of the vehicle, leaving some areas open.




Concentrated Barrage:
Pilot Only: No 
Silhouette: 5+
Current Speed: 0-3
The gunner directs the vehicle’s fire to focus on a precise point on the opponent’s hull. Focusing fire in this way has the potential to deal significant damage. This action also speeds up combat when your vehicle has lots of guns.
        When performing the Concentrated Barrage action, the character selects all weapons of a single type (such as 24-pounder cannons aboard a seagoing craft, or railguns aboard a starship) that share a firing arc. This action requires at least two weapons to use, and it cannot be used if there are not two weapons of a single type that share a firing arc. Although the character is firing multiple weapons, the character makes a single combat check, as per the rules for the Perform a Combat Check with Vehicle Weapons action. If the attack succeeds, the character may spend an Advantage once to add damage equal to the number of weapons involved in the attack to one hit of the attack.
        The Concentrated Barrage action can only be used to target vehicles with a silhouette of 5 or higher.
Damage Control:
Pilot Only: No 
Silhouette: Any
Current Speed: Any
As a vehicle takes damage, sparks fly and systems begin to fail. The Damage Control action can mitigate this stress. When performing the Damage Control action, choose whether you want your character to repair system strain or hull trauma. Then, make a Mechanics check, with the difficulty determined by the accompanying table. If the check is successful, reduce the vehicle’s system strain or hull trauma by one per uncanceled Success.
        Characters can use the Damage Control action to repair system strain multiple times during an encounter. However, only one Damage Control action can be made to repair hull trauma during an encounter—no matter how many characters are on the vehicle. In both cases, you decide whether your players’ characters can use the Damage Control action, depending on the current situation (a fighter pilot probably couldn’t climb out of their plane to patch their wing, after all).  
        Characters can also use this action to repair Critical Hits the vehicle is suffering from. The difficulty of repairing a Critical Hit is listed in the Severity column of the Critical Hit table. Checks to repair Critical Hits can be attempted multiple times, until the Critical Hit is repaired. 
Gain the Advantage:
Pilot Only: Yes 
Silhouette: 1-4
Current Speed: 4+
This action reflects the frantic give-and-take of a dogfight between small vehicles. It allows a pilot to gain the upper hand against a single enemy vehicle, maneuvering to deny that foe shots while setting up attacks of their own.  
        To execute this action, the pilot chooses one enemy vehicle and makes a Driving or Piloting check, the difficulty of which is determined by the relative speeds of the vehicles involved in the attack (see the accompanying table). If the pilot succeeds, they gain the advantage. While a pilot has the advantage, upgrade the ability of all combat checks made from the pilot’s vehicle against the target vehicle twice, and upgrade the difficulty of all combat checks made by the target vehicle against the pilot’s vehicle twice.
        Once one pilot gains the advantage, on the following turn, the opponent may attempt to cancel out the advantage by using Gain the Advantage as well. This works as described earlier, but the difficulty of the Piloting check is increased by one. After all, it is harder to maneuver to get on an opponent's tail if that opponent is already on your tail! 
Additional Vehicle Actions:
Pilot Only: No
Silhouette: Any
Current Speed: Any
When aboard a vehicle in combat, those who are not piloting or firing weapons may still want to contribute to the encounter. Although the number of options open to them is limited only by a player’s creativity, the following table has a list of actions passengers can attempt during encounters. The table lists the actions, the skill required, the check’s attendant difficulty, and the results of a success. These actions are all covered by the perform a skill check action, and are by no means an exhaustive list—and obviously, not all of these actions are appropriate for all vehicles or settings, so you should be sure to use common sense when choosing actions. However, they do serve to provide a range of ideas.


  

Perform a Combat Check with Vehicle Weapons:
Pilot Only: No
Silhouette: Any
Current Speed: Any
This is similar to the perform a combat check action that was discussed during Structured Gameplay, with some minor differences in implementation due to the differences between vehicles and individuals. These differences are described below:
* Each weapon on a vehicle may be fired a maximum of once per round.
* Targets must be within the firing arc of the weapon, as determined by the relative position of vehicles (and the GM’s discretion).
* Although the attack difficulty is still based on the range to the target, vehicle rules do add the sixth—strategic—range band. Attacks made at strategic range have a difficulty of Formidable. Also, vehicles have wide variance in silhouettes, so you should be sure to use the Size Differences rules. 
* Most weapons on vehicles deal damage on planetary scale, meaning each point of damage is the equivalent of ten points of damage on a personal scale.
* When a vehicle suffers damage, it reduces that damage by its armor, to a minimum of 0. Any remaining damage is applied to the vehicle as hull trauma.
Vehicle Critical Hits:
Vehicles do not suffer Critical Injuries; instead, when a vehicle would otherwise suffer a Critical Injury due to Advantage or Triumph on an attack (or any other effect), it suffers a Critical Hit instead. Effects that apply to the results of Critical Injuries, such as the Vicious quality, do not apply to Critical Hits (and effects that apply to Critical Hits do not apply to Critical Injuries).
        When an attack generates a Critical Hit, the attacker rolls on the table below, and the target suffers the listed effects. Critical Hits are divided into four severity levels, which dictate the difficulty of the check required to repair the Critical Hit, as listed in the table. These difficulties can be further modified at your discretion. 
        Once a vehicle suffers a Critical Hit, it counts as suffering that Critical Hit until it is repaired. This status counts even if the effects of the Critical Hit only last a single round. While a vehicle is suffering a Critical Hit, any additional Critical Hits generated against it add +10 to the roll on the Critical Hit table.
        Remember that an attack must inflict damage for the attacker to activate a Critical Hit. Because vehicles operate on the planetary scale for damage, a hit from a personal scale weapon must inflict at least 10 damage (1 damage on planetary scale) after reductions for armor for the attacker to be able to inflict a Critical Hit.  
Hacking Rules:
Dramatized electronic warfare is often presented as a sort of duel between two master technologists. Although this isn’t how that works in real life, our game tends to err on the side of an exciting narrative, and so for this setting, we’ve provided some hacking rules that enable this.  


Encounter Structure:
A full hacking encounter is often conducted in structured gameplay. In a hacking encounter, one or more hackers try to access a system, override its security programs, and then do something important in the system—ranging from looping security camera footage and unlocking electronic doors to stealing sensitive corporate data. 
        You can create an entire hacking encounter where the hackers attempt to overcome automated programs and defenses. However, sometimes the hackers face off against a living opponent. This systems operator (or “sysops”) tries to trace the hackers to find out where they are accessing the system from, then attempts to lock them out of the system entirely. If the sysops can lock out the hackers before the hackers accomplish their goals, the sysops wins.
        Since hacking encounters take place in structured gameplay, you, as the GM, should use the rules for Initiative to determine the order in which characters act. Also, since hacking encounters use the same structured gameplay rules as combat encounters, you can run a combined hacking and combat encounter easily, instead of leaving the rest of the party with nothing to do while the hacker PC gets their time in the spotlight. You could have the other PCs engaging in other actions (such as a tense firefight with security or an attempt to break into a protected building) while the hacker engages in the hacking encounter. The hacker can even help their fellows, such as by opening doors to allow a quick escape or by activating a fire suppression system right in a security guard’s face.
        During a hacking encounter, we call any character attempting to break into a computer system a “hacker.” We call a character actively working to protect the system a “sysop” (sort for "system operator"). 


A Link to the System:
Generally, characters need some sort of link to a computer system to hack it. This involves some sort of hardware (a computer or portable computing device) and a link into whatever network or Internet your setting has.
        It could probably go without saying that hackers and sysops must both have this link to a system to be able to hack or protect it. If a character can’t access the system, they cannot perform any hacking actions or maneuvers involving that system, and none of their talents or special abilities can affect the system. 


Actions:
During a hacking encounter, characters can perform a number of hacking actions to accomplish their goals. We describe these actions, listing their difficulty, whether they can be performed by a hacker or sysops (or both), and providing you with a description of how they work.
Access System:
Difficulty: Computers check (Difficulty Varies)
Available To: Hacker
Once the hacker has a direct link to the system (through a land-line, wireless connection, USB port, or something more futuristic), they need to access the system. This action represents the hacker accessing the system and gaining control over it, so that they can make the system do what they want later. 
        As an action, the hacker may make a Computers check to gain access to the system. The difficulty of the check is based on the system’s basic security and complexity.
        Once a hacker has successfully accessed a system, they can use the enact commands maneuver to do things in the system (what they can do depends on what system they accessed, of course). However, certain parts of a system may be further protected by security programs. The hacker needs to override these security programs before they can access those parts of a system. 
Override Security Program:
Difficulty: Average Computers Check
Available To: Hacker
Once a hacker has successfully performed the access system action, certain parts of a system may still be protected by security programs. For example, a hacker may gain access to a facility’s security camera network and be able to see whatever the security cameras see. However, the part of the system that controls the cameras is protected by a security program, which the hacker must override before they can turn the cameras off. 
        Each security program has a strength rating. To override the program, the hacker must make an Average Computers check and generate a number of Success equal to the program’s rating. If the hacker fails, something (usually bad) happens, depending on the security program.
        If the hacker succeeds, the program shuts down, and cannot be reactivated until the end of the hacker’s next turn. Hackers can spend Advantage or Triumph to keep a program shut down longer, or completely disable it.
Trace User:
Difficulty: Opposed Computers vs Computers check
Available To: Sysop
Once the sysops knows that their system is being hacked, they still need to find out where the hack is coming from. The more they know about the origin of the hack, the easier it is to lock the hacker out of their system.
        To find out where the hack is coming from, the sysops needs to trace the hacker by performing the trace user action. The sysops makes an opposed Computers vs Computers check targeting the hacker. If successful, the sysops narrows down the hacker’s location once. This makes it easier to lock the hacker out of the system (see the Lockout action), and also provides information about the hacker’s real-world location. See the accompanying table to see what a successful trace provides.
        Besides making it easy for the sysops to lock the hacker out of the system, the sysops can also use this information for other purposes, such as reporting the hacker to the police (or sending a black-ops team to the hacker’s house). You can also rule that a sysops needs to perform the trace user action to learn other key details about the hacker, such as how to access the hacker’s computer over the Internet. You can even allow a hacker to perform the trace user action to learn the physical location of someone online, such as an enemy sysops or a rival hacker. 
  



Lockout:
Difficulty: Formidable Computers check
Available To: Sysop
Since the sysops has direct control over the system, they can lock any users out of the system. As long as they can find the hacker, they can give them the boot.
        Once the sysops is aware of a hacker’s presence, the sysops may make a Formidable Computers check. If successful, the hacker loses access to the system. At the GM’s discretion, they may be able to regain access to the system by performing the Access System action again. However, at the very least the difficulty of this action should be increased twice. 
        Reduce the difficulty of Lockout once for every successful trace against the hacker, to a minimum of Easy


Maneuvers:
In a hacking encounter, there are also certain maneuvers that a character can perform while interacting with a system. They follow the same format as hacking actions, but without a difficulty since they don't require a check.
Enact Command:
Available To: Hacker, Sysop
This maneuver is how characters do things within a system after they access it. What they can do with this maneuver could range from looping the footage of specific security cameras in a facility, locking or unlocking electronic security doors, shutting down power to an elevator, resetting a drone’s targeting parameters, or downloading a cache of corporate information.
        Enact command should only let a character perform a single command in the system (if what a player wants their character to do is too complex, you can require them to spend two or more enact command maneuvers to do it). However, it doesn’t require a check, since once characters have bypassed security, the system thinks they’re authorized users (or, if the character is a sysops, they actually are authorized users). 
        Characters can only perform this maneuver after they have successfully performed the Access System action and gained access to the computer system. Also, remember that some parts of a system may be protected behind firewalls, which must be overridden before the character can enact commands that affect that part of the system.
Activate Programs:
Available To: Hacker, Sysop
 Characters use this maneuver to activate (or reactivate) security programs, as well as any other programs that help or hinder hacking that you may have created for your setting. 




Spending Advantage, Threat, Triumph, and Despair:
When a hacker’s check results in Advantage, Threat, Triumph, or Despair, these symbols may be spent narratively as usual. Additionally, the following table offers further suggestions. Options labeled “Hacker Only” are available only to a hacker, while “Sysops Only” options can only be used by a sysops.
